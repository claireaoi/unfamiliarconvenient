Introducing Roomba® s9+ robot vacuum. A suite of groundbreaking technology built into a brand-new design cleans close into corners and along edges, maps your home, and empties on its own. It’s our smartest, most powerful robot vacuum yet.
Advanced technology, advanced cleaning.
Engineered to do more. Increased suction lifts away dirt and debris. Imprint™ Technology allows the s series robot vacuums to learn, map, and adapt to your home, determining the best way to clean. Plus, the Roomba® s9+ robot empties its own bin so you don’t have to think about vacuuming for weeks at a time.
Corners. Edges. And the details in between.™
PerfectEdge® Technology with our newly designed Corner Brush for optimized cleaning deep into corners and along edges.
Pollen and mold allergens, trapped.
With an Anti-Allergen System, 99% of pollen and mold allergens are trapped and locked in—from the robot to the Clean Base—without escaping back into the air.
Knows where it’s been and what’s left to clean.
vSLAM® technology uses an optical sensor to capture over 230,400 data points per second, allowing the robot to create an accurate map of its surroundings so it knows where it is, where it's been, and where it needs to clean.
Stays in bounds
Keep Out Zones allow you to clean with added control, actively avoiding the areas you tell your robot not to go, like around pet bowls and toys. Once you set a zone it will remain in place for all future cleaning jobs.
