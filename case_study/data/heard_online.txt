Start tracking today.  most commonly come from the clitoris, located above the vaginal opening and urethra   are areas of the body that elicit a sexual response when stimulated. This can include the genital area,  The clitoris is one of the most sensitive erogenous zones due to its high concentration of nerve endings (4,5). By stimulating an erogenous zone, a sexual physiological response can be set into motion. The clitoris is part of the vulva, the name for the external parts of female genitalia. The vagina is the tube connecting the vulva and the  Stimulation of the clitoris can be applied directly, internally (through the vagina), and/or through stimulation of the other parts of the vulva.  Many people with vaginas—despite perhaps enjoying and getting excited from penetrative sex—don’t always orgasm from intercourse.  Every person is different, and has different sexual erogenous zones, desires, and turn ons. We cannot stress this enough! There is no “one best way” to stimulate the clitoris — you’ll need to do some experimenting.   setting the mood could involve kissing, foreplay, and exploring each other’s bodies.   feel free to get comfortable with any other erogenous zones of your body (like your nipples). Don’t forget your mind — if you want and aren’t feeling particularly turned on by your imagination, you can also get your head in the game with some porn or sexy literature.  Using whatever you like: your fingers, your partners finger’s or mouth/tongue, or another (clean) object like a sex toy. You can also try using a shower head, vibrator, or even the friction of your underwear against something, like a pillow. Once you feel comfortable with the area around the clitoris and are ready, it’s time to directly stimulate the clitoris. The clitoris is not just a magic button, so simply pressing it (for most people) won’t instantly produce an orgasm. Don’t pretend to be a DJ either by forcefully scratching it back and forth—nobody likes that.   Hi, I am Steph! I’ll send you both educational and entertaining stories about women’s health and share tips and tricks to get the most out of your Clue app! You could try gentle back and forth motions, small circular motions, or even a light tap.  Engage the clitoral hood too—remember, it also has nerve endings and the body of the body of the clitoris curves back behind it, before becoming buried inside your pelvis. Check in with yourself or your partner—does this feel good?  5. You can start experimenting with pressure, speed, body parts (like tongues if you are with a partner), toys, or vibration.  7. You can also try stimulating the clitoris from the inside using a penis, sex-toy, or fingers. Not everyone will be able to be stimulated or even reach an orgasm the first time, or every time, they have sex or masturbate—and that’s okay.  The only real important thing is that you enjoy yourself. If you aren’t having fun, don’t do it.  The clitoris—both its anatomy and function—is a hotly debated topic (1). Taboos about discussing women’s sexuality and pleasure have contributed to the lack of research in these areas. But as taboos are broken, more research will hopefully provide further clarity in understanding the clitoris.
 The existence or function of the G-spot is not 100 percent clear. Some research claims it could be associated with female ejaculation (also known as  Other researchers suggest that the G-spot isn’t necessarily an actual physical entity, but instead the place where the sides of the vestibular bulbs of the clitoris make contact with the anterior wall of the vagina (12).  This suggests that a “vaginal orgasm” may actually still be connected to the clitoris—each thrust during penetrative vaginal intercourse or contraction of the pelvic muscles—can stimulate the clitoris (1,2,12). The quality, consistency, and volume of cervical fluid types changes along with... The external part of the clitoris, the glans clitoris, as well as the clitoral hood, can vary greatly from person to person.   can cause the clitoris to enlarge during any life stage, including during development in the womb, during childhood, and during adulthood (13). When a clitoris size is large enough to be considered abnormal, this is called   and the clitoris are related in structure to one another. In fact, they actually originate from the same developmental tissue (5). At eight weeks of fetal development, the Y chromosome on male DNA will activate the differentiation of the genital tissue to develop into a penis, instead of a clitoris (3-5). Many of the parts of the clitoris are similar to that of the penis, but differ in shape and size, and are located in different places.  Everybody reaches orgasm differently. Experimenting with masturbation or sex positions—and having patience—can help you figure out what works best for you.

Cue your Oprah voice, because you get a hard-on, and you get a hard-on, and you get a hard-on… That’s right, folks of all genders and genitalia can get erections, not just people with penises!  But chances are you didn’t learn that in health class. So, to help you become more cliterate, we put together this sheet on clitoral erections.  When most people say “clit,” they’re usually talking about the sensitive love button that sits at the apex of the labia (your down-there lips).  . It’s just the external part, known as the glans. There’s an internal part, too.  The clitoris extends back into the body (usually close to 4 inches!) and around the vaginal canal, explains Garrison. If you were to extract the clit entirely from the body, it’d look a bit like a wishbone.  When aroused, blood rushes to the erectile tissue that makes up the clit (the same tissue as in a penis), causing it to become engorged. This is a clitoral erection.  Yep! Individuals who have a penis get erections when blood flow gets directed to their erectile tissues.  The difference is that when folks who have a vulva get erections, you can’t really see them, because  When erect, the part of the clit you can see (the glans) “will peak out of the clitoral hood and grow in size 50 to 300 percent,” according to  “And the vaginal lips will swell during arousal so that they are two to three times bigger than usual,” she said.  And remember: Even the parts of the clitoral structure you can’t see swell and engorge as a result of the increased blood flow.  “You’re not going to see the clitoris grow a few inches and point up to the sky,” Garrison says. That’s because, again, most of the erection happens on the inside.   will pull back, and the external bud will become engorged, making it more visible.  The inner and outer labia may also become engorged and swollen. And because the Bartholin glands inside the vagina sometimes secrete lubrication during arousal, the clit and surrounding labia may glisten with the  To the touch, the clit itself will generally feel harder and bigger than usual. “How hard exactly depends on the clit owner,” Garrison says. To the touch, it can be super-duper sensitive.  But if you have a clitoris and you’re reading this, it’s possible that you’ve gotten a clitoral erection when you were aroused and didn’t really notice.  Many folks won’t recognize their clitoral erection as a clitoral erection, explains Garrison.  “They’ll feel that ‘I’m turned on’ feeling and enjoy the physical sensations that typically accompany that, but won’t feel anything ‘special’ outside of that,” he says.  Still, for other folks, a clitoral erection produces much more obvious sensation.   woman, says, “Yeah, my clit gets hard and swollen when I’m turned on. And it’s, like, 100 times more sensitive in this state than it is normally.” Jake B., a 25-year-old trans man on testosterone, says, “After about 2 months on T my clit started to grow, and now when I’m aroused it becomes very visible erect. When that happens, it feels really good, almost tingly. It’s become super sensitive.”  This probably won’t surprise you, but research on the topic is completely MIA. More research is needed to conclusively answer this question.  As Garrison explains, “really anything that makes you hornier can make the erection stronger or more pleasurable.”  The clit, like the penis, is at its most sensitive when you’re aroused. And if you have a clitoral erection, chances are you’re horny. So   use suction technology to stimulate and increase blood flow to the clit,” Garrison says, adding that this can strengthen the erection.  “It allows you to jerk off the clit in a similar way that you would with a Fleshlight or any other penile masturbation sleeve,” he says.   is the practice of stopping yourself from reaching orgasm right before you’re about to get off over and over in order to make the final orgasm better.  “Edging will increase the amount of time you have a clitoral erection and make it stronger,” Jeffcoat says.  Because the pelvic floor plays a role in all sexual functioning, Jeffcoat notes that “making sure your pelvic floor muscles are strong and healthy can also help.”  Note: This doesn’t mean doing Kegels all willy-nilly. It means visiting a pelvic floor therapist who can assess the health of your pelvic floor and give you at-home exercises to try  So, things that support healthy blood flow, like a balanced diet, regular exercise, and not smoking or drinking, will help make your hard-on better, he says.  While getting a clitoral erection is a normal and healthy response to being aroused, it isn’t something that should be happening in the absence of sexual stimulation.  PGAD is a condition that can result in folks being aroused and having a clitoral erection even when there isn’t any physical, visual, aural, or other sexual stimulation happening.  “Priapism is when there’s an erection, but there’s zero sexual arousal,” Garrison says. “Usually the erections last 4 or more hours and can become painful.”  There are many possible causes for these conditions, but the most common include:  “In addition to being painful, prolonged clitoral erection can result in scar tissue [that] can form underneath the clitoris that is very difficult to remove,” she says.  When you’re aroused, it can become hard, extra sensitive, and pretty and pink in color. So long as the erection isn’t spontaneous, painful, or seriously long lasting, just enjoy it!

But in reality that little love button is only the tip of a surprisingly complex iceberg called the internal clitoris.  live panel, a gathering of the sex industry’s most brilliant minds to discuss sexuality, vaginas, and women’s pleasure. Those minds included Alex Fine, cofounder of  ). These women are basically the experts on everything clit science—and yes, clit science is totally a thing. So what are all the things the mysterious internal clitoris do? Here's some of the most important stuff to know about this amazing organ: Let’s get biological! The clitoris as a whole is composed of an external circular mass of glans, with bulbous internal extensions (called the vestibular bulbs) and internal winglike extensions (called the corpus cavernosum). In a sonogram picture it looks a bit like an eagle in flight, descending upon its prey. “The clitoris continues on inside of the body, allowing for clitoral stimulation via the vaginal wall and other parts of the vulva,” Alex Fine explained. The external part of the clitoris is probably the part you're most familiar with (and if you’re not, you better go find it ASAP). , and is made up of the same erectile tissue as the penis—it even fills with blood and becomes engorged when we’re aroused, just like a how a dude’s junk does. In a lot of ways, it really is the female equivalent of the penis, but we don’t need to call it that because women deserve control and agency over their bodies. But it’s not just the part of the clit we can see that reacts when you’re aroused. According to Rebecca Brightman, M.D., an ob-gyn at  , the entire clitoris is “0.5 to 2 cm in length, and the glans is less than 1 cm. The entire clitoral complex—including the internal wings—will become engorged and enlarged with stimulation.”  comes from research done in the nineties. No, not the 1890s: The medical community was still largely uninterested in female pleasure until 20 years ago.  that the medical community didn’t know about the clitoris’ identical makeup to the penis until—surprise, surprise—a female urologist named Helen O’Connell, M.D., figured it out while dissecting cadavers. She published her work, “  knew that their lady bits were a source of pleasure long before science caught up, doctors and scientists believed the clit was a rather straightforward piece of anatomy. The assumption was that the clitoris was comprised entirely of a small exterior bundle, with nothing to see below. It wasn’t until   that its deeper, internal structure was finally revealed. Not only that, but “the first 3-D sonography of the clitoris happened in 2008,” says Fine. Scientists   were two of the leading researchers in uncovering its full structure, using sonograms to document its movement, sensitivity, and what it looked like. Yup, even G-spot orgasms (the G-spot is actually the spot closest to the root of the clit). Of course, there’s much more to the female orgasm than the clitoris, or even the vagina for that matter. Female pleasure is derived from a variety of pleasure points; clusters of muscles and nerves on various erogenous zones, such as the nipples, ears, and thighs. Women’s bodies are complex, with a vast number of pleasurable pathways to explore. Still, the clitoris may exist for more than just sexy times. The clitoris, says Dr. Brightman, “plays a role in sexual response: During ovulation women have an increased sex drive and libido. Positive sexual experiences foster procreation. So, indirectly, the clitoris plays another role than just pleasure.” After all, if we don’t enjoy sex, how can we be expected to have it and make babies? When it comes to women’s bodies, it’s safe to say the clit is queen—even if there’s still probably a lot more to know about the clitoris, pleasure, and sexuality as a whole.  may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

It looks like a tulip emoji, but this anatomically accurate clitoris will aid education and debunk myths that have repressed women’s sexuality for centuries But it was worth the wait. The truth is, you might struggle to gain pleasure from a tool you don’t even know you have. In 2016, women finally know without speculation what the whole of their sexual organ looks like; and for many it won’t be quite what  You may be wondering, what’s the big deal? Is the clitoris not the “small, sensitive, erectile part of the female genitals at the anterior end of the vulva”, as   defines it? And isn’t the real issue simply whether it brings a woman sexual gratification? Well, decide for yourself. The popular opinion seems to be that the 3D printed clitoris resembles a wishbone. To my eyes, it also (fittingly) resembles a fleur-de-lys, or, to use a more contemporary example, a  But the important thing is that it debunks myths that have repressed female sexuality for centuries. For one, it refutes the   education that wrongly asserts the clitoris is the size of “a fingertip”, a “pea” or that it is small. We can now clearly see that the clitoris includes two shafts (crura) which are actually about 10cm long. Not only can we visualise that the clitoris is more than what the eye perceives; with the visual model we can also now get a mental image of how it  , making penetrative sex potentially orgasmic. This means that a demystified discussion about the  Moreover, with the 3D model, the uninformed ways that women’s bodies are represented, whether through sex education, pop culture or pornography, now just seem silly.

Feminists have been insisting that there was a lot more to the clitoris than popularly believed – especially since urologist Helen O’Toole  . Nonetheless, imagine a world where it is common knowledge what a woman’s primary anatomically sexual organ looks like. Imagine how sexually empowered women who can visualise their clits will be. Imagine too how confident men can be when freed from the epidemic deception that satisfying a woman is like winning in the lottery. And lastly, imagine being able to respond to inquisitive children who want to know why Jane’s and John’s genitals are different, with a logical and factual answer – that a clitoris is like an internal penis and a penis like an external clitoris.

If you have a clitoris, those are four words you never want to hear from a new sexual partner. To get serious, most people (those with vulvas and those without) think very little about their anatomy. They know what makes them feel good, of course, and they probably know the scientific names for the key sex organs – although many people may be more familiar with their slang names than their scientific ones. First, it lets you converse more accurately with a health professional when you’re having pain or dealing with a medical issue. Perhaps more importantly, understanding sexual anatomy can help you and your partner(s) to have serious discussions about erogenous zones: what you like, what you don’t, and what you can do to achieve mutual sexual satisfaction and a better sex life. So what is the clitoris? If you’ll forgive the mixed metaphor, let’s plunge right in.  of the clitoris. Those who don’t have one may think of it as either the small button (technically called the  , or just the glans) above the vagina – or as the “thing they’re supposed to play with.” Those who own clitorises, of course, are likely to have more specific awareness of the organ’s location and the sexual responses they feel when it’s stimulated. However, there’s a lot more to know about the clitoris, including the fact that it isn’t just an external organ. The clitoris is an entire system of body parts, both external and internal. It’s understandable that many people are largely in the dark when it comes to the clitoris. In fact, the 1948 edition of  No one has ever understood that odd decision made by editor Dr. Charles Mayo Goss. Theories include Goss agreeing with Freud that the organ is a “small penis which does not grow any bigger” and that  ,” or more general “concerns” about morality and hygiene. The organ’s existence was miraculously restored to Gray’s Anatomy in 1955. Yet even today, many medical diagrams incorrectly picture the clitoris and other parts of the vulva, and a few texts still refer to the clitoris simply as the female penis. Back in the 16th and 17th century, Italian and Dutch anatomists actually had a pretty good, albeit rudimentary, understanding of female genitalia. However, Freud’s declarations about the relative unimportance of the clitoris largely relegated it to the anatomical dust heap. When it was discussed after that only the glans was mentioned. It took another 50 years or so before a true understanding of the clitoris was widely circulated and accepted, thanks to Australian urologist Dr. Helen O’Connell. She and her team examined cadavers, compared them to existing anatomy texts, and confirmed their findings by doing MRIs on a number of patients. Her detailed   by Odile Buisson and Pierre Foldès, revealed that the organ is much more than just the glans. (There is still debate among some experts in gynecology, like  O’Connell’s work showed that the clitoris is really an entire system with 18 different components, almost all of them Let’s look at the outside first. We’ve already mentioned the glans clitoris, located above both the vagina opening and the urethra, toward the top of the vulva. There are two reasons most people focus on the glans. One is that it’s the prominent external part of the clitoris. The other is that it’s the most sensitive part of the entire system, with more than   (more than in the tip of the penis!) able to produce immense pleasure during clitoral stimulation. Fun fact 2: even experts on “female sexuality” can’t agree on whether the glans becomes erect during “female sexual pleasure” and before “female orgasm.” (Spoiler alert: it does.) Needless to say, researchers generally cling to outdated gender stereotypes. There are several other parts of the vulva which aren’t technically parts of the clitoris, yet are very important to it. The labia majora and labia minora (outer and inner lips) form concentric ovals around the glans. The outer lips are primarily for protection, and are one of the areas where pubic hair grows. The inner lips provide even more protection, and also secrete some of the natural lube that makes sex play more comfortable. There’s also the clitoral hood, which is a fold of skin formed where the two sides of the labia minora meet. It protects the glans from friction, but usually retracts during sexual arousal (or can be pulled back if necessary for sexual stimulation). One note before we move on. Some people feel dissatisfied with the appearance of their glans and labia, but everyone’s external elements look a little different. Their appearance generally has no relation to sexual health or sexual pleasure, and there’s no such thing as “normal” shapes, colors or size. Here’s where we get to the “hidden parts” of the clitoris under the skin. Put your biology goggles on for a few minutes. Behind the glans is the clitoral body, which runs through the pelvis and is connected to the pubic bone by a ligament. The clitoral body is largely composed of two spongy areas of erectile tissue known as corpora cavernosa, which diverge in the shape of a wishbone and then extend into two crura (legs). Experts may argue over whether the glans becomes erect during arousal, but they agree that the corpora cavernosa and crura definitely do. (The two chambers in the penis which become erect are known by the same name.) The female corpora cavernosa are each capped by expandable vestibular bulbs. The bulbs of the clitoris and the crura fill with blood during sexual arousal, causing the structure of the clitoris and the vulva to expand. This action serves several purposes. It increases the sensitivity of the vulva, while also putting pressure on the vaginal canal – causing the release of lubrication and increasing the  . In fact, Buisson and Foldès argue that G-spot orgasms (and ejaculation) may occur because the sensitive parts of the clitoris are pulled so close to the vaginal wall. That’s enough biology for now. Let’s answer a few questions and clear up a few misconceptions. . They’re similar in genetic information and physical attributes, and are formed from the same embryonic cells. During fetal development, however, the DNA in those with Y chromosomes activates the mechanism by which a penis develops. In those without Y chromosomes, the formation of a clitoris (or what society thinks of as “female genitalia”) progresses naturally. : To put it simply: pleasure. The clitoris is one of most sensitive erogenous zones known to humans, and its stimulation produces sensations unlike any other. To put it in mathematical terms: one of the major   conducted on the subject found that more than one-third of vulva owners couldn’t reach orgasm without clitoral stimulation, while only about 18% were able to climax from just vaginal penetration. : Ask those who’ve experienced both, and you’ll hear nearly unanimous agreement that they feel very different. Ask anatomists, though, and you’ll learn that the answer is more complicated. The clitoris plays a big role in the sensations experienced during vaginal play, and “achieving orgasm” is a subjective description based on individual preferences, feelings and desires. As Pfaus et. al. summarized in their important  y, the application of sex-specific descriptions of orgasms “only serves to obfuscate and hide the truly remarkable variety of orgasmic experiences a woman (sic) can have.” : If you haven’t spent time exploring your erogenous zones, it’s quite possible that you’re not. Experimentation with fingers, sex toys (be sure to use the right type of vibrator), partners, friction – and imagination – may lead you to surprising and delightful new discoveries about one of the most important areas of your body. : Sadly, the procedure known as female genital mutilation (or female circumcision) is still practiced in some societies. The goal of removing or damaging the glans was – and unfortunately, still is – to make sex less pleasurable, in order to discourage the mutilation victim from cheating on a partner. The practice is thankfully illegal in most developed nations.  <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1027/2873/t/457/assets/enter-your-email.png?v=4564886109369731217" alt="Enter your email..." />  Swell is Dame's digital resource for stories about sexual wellness and human intimacy.

 is command central of the female orgasm. Perched atop the labia minora, its sole purpose and function is sexual pleasure. It has more nerve endings than the penis, and—although affected by conditions that reduce blood supply—it can retain sensitivity as you age. Most of the clitoris is out of sight, extending deep within and around your vagina and labia. “The most recent anatomical research suggests that the clitoris is perhaps better described as the 'clitoral complex,' where the vagina, urethra, and clitoris all function as a unit rather than as individual parts," says Dr. Debby Herbenick, in  Unlike the penis, the clitoris can orgasm repeatedly without a refactory (rest) period. Clitoral orgasms also last from between 10 to 30 seconds and involve from 3 to 15 contractions, which can reach from the abdomen to the vagina. So, rather than creating artificial divisions and hierarchies between whether an orgasm is vaginal or clitoral, why not view the whole area as one big erogenous zone? Clitoral orgasms involve the vagina and vice versa, so neither is “better” or more desirable. Every orgasm is right on the money. Use what works, rather than focusing on the vagina, which as you know, can get a little cranky right about now. And if you can coach your partner on some clitoral finesse, lovemaking could take on a whole new dimension. , is “homologous” to a penis—it has the same biological features. Thus, it has to be treated gently. Too much or too rough and it’ll either hurt or go numb. So start slow and gentle.  on low. The glans (head) is usually too sensitive to touch directly, so stroke the hood over the top of the glans, stroke around the labia minora and the vaginal vestibule. Stroke inner thighs, breasts, nipples. Use round and round and over the top motion on the clitoris. For the partner: Tongue action on and around the clitoris is very erotic. Done well, it can make her “come” all by itself. Don’t jump into action. Get things warmed up with your best foreplay action. Then, with lubed fingers begin a gentle, playful massage downtown—gently stroke her inner labia, across, over and around her clitoris. As your partner becomes aroused, slide between her legs and begin using your tongue, licking firmly up the tiny shaft of the clitoris, using separate strokes at first. Vary the action with quick darting motions on the exposed glans or by flicking her clitoris with your tongue. Begin using a firmer, continual stroke without breaking contact until she begins to orgasm. You can then quickly move to penis-in-vagina action until you orgasm, or you can cup her “mound” with the palm of your hand, applying gentle pressure to her clitoris, which feels very comforting. You don’t have to go crazy with the tongue action (how exhausting that would be!). Set the scene well with foreplay; keep the action gentle and varied, increasing both the frequency and firmness as she becomes aroused. Some handwork on her breast and nipples helps. And remember, practice makes perfect! Good positions to increase clitoral contact during sex include the faithful missionary but with the partner pressing down to engage the clit. Either partner can reach the clitoris if she’s on top or in the rear entry position. “There's no need to be overly fancy during sex—the very best positions are the ones that focus on the clitoris,” says author and sexologist  Finally, the clitoris needs good blood flow to be its best orgasmic self—and orgasms boost the immune system, support a healthy sleep cycle, and help keep your hormones balanced.

			 We all think we know everything we need to know about our clitorises. They're awesome, stimulating, they're the primary way women have orgasms, and ...what else is there? The answer is: a lot. Here, Dr. Emily Nagoski, director of wellness education at Smith College and author of , and other experts dole out some helpful info to help uncover everything you didn't know about your favorite body part ever.   Even though it looks like the small button begins and ends there, the clitoris actually extends deep into the body, all the way down to the mouth of the vagina and also has internal structures as well, kind of like a wishbone. Who knew?! 3. Those same internal clitoral structures might actually be what we think of as the G-spot. , and they found that during penetration, the vagina flexes in a way that makes the penis rub through the vaginal wall and onto the internal structures of the clitoris, which people often think is G-spot stimulation. It can vary from woman to woman, but for some women, when they experience G-spot orgasms, it's actually just an internal extension of the clit.  We're all told that the clit is the only organ designed purely for pleasure, but that's not true. It's actually designed for sensation. But if you're not turned on, any kind of clitoral stimulation might not actually feel good. Basically, it's not a magic doorbell that you can press at any time of day and everything will magically open up for you. You have to be in the mood first for anything to happen there.  5. Clitorises vary greatly in size, anything from tiny peas to a reasonably sized gherkin pickle.  The size really can vary that much, and every size, from the smallest to the largest, is completely normal (unless you're experiencing pain, in which case, you should see a doctor).  , blood rushes to the genitals, making your clit actually swell to a larger size. 7. Just because you have a large clit doesn't mean you're less sensitive or more sensitive.  It just means your clit is larger, but there's no connection between the size of your clit and what kind of stimulation it likes. It could be larger and like less stimulation or prefer more stimulation. You really can't tell just by looking at it.  This is especially important for people dating vagina owners: Just because you can give one clit orgasms doesn't mean that, when the next one comes along, you'd be able to do the same for them. For example, in oral sex some clits like a flat, soft tongue and others like a flicky, hard tongue. So your guy might've been able to make one woman come by using the same method every time, but then when he goes down on you, that might not feel great at all. Every clit is different. Like a snowflake on your vulva.

          A collaborative effort of the 502nd Trainer Development Squadron and Air Education and Training Command Aerospace Physiology Lead Command, the unaided night vision trainer, also known as an NV light bar, demonstrates how dark adaptation and various types of lighting enhance unaided night vision. (U.S. Air Force courtesy photo)  to help aircrew and paratrooper students understand night vision threats during initial aerospace physiology training will soon become a standard trainer across the Air Force.  Aerospace Physiology Lead Command, the unaided night vision trainer, also known as an NV light bar, demonstrates how dark adaptation and various types of lighting enhance unaided night vision. The Air Force has been working with a night vision box/light bar for more than 30 years, but these devices were permanently affixed to classrooms and over time have broken or no longer work, said Senior Master Sgt. Ismael Paez Jr., AETC aerospace physiology functional manager. “The device the 502nd TDS is developing for us is bringing us into the 21st century,” he said. “This device will be mobile, can be controlled via remote and can operate on batteries.” The aerospace physiology career field has a waiver in place to forgo the requirement to use the night vision device while ensuring training objectives are met, Paez said, but that will change with the new device. “Once the new night vision light bar is produced, we’ll go from having a handful of legacy devices to more than 40 devices across the Air Force,” he said. Work on the unaided NV trainer began a few years ago in response to a request from an aerospace physiology technician and aerospace physiology training systems program manager, said Josh Chesney, 502nd TDS program manager. “The current training is done in a classroom setting with a projector and PowerPoint presentation,” he said. “This device will provide more realistic training.” The training teaches students about the limitations of the human visual system under low lighting conditions and the illusions they may experience under those conditions. A rectangular black box that works in tandem with a remote control, the NV light bar demonstrates a variety of anomalies that challenge aircrews. One of these is autokinesis, a nighttime visual illusion that causes a stationary light to appear to move. The demonstration of this illusion helps fliers recognize the causes, effects and appropriate prevention of autokinesis during flight, free fall and while under canopy. The instructor turns on a single red light in the middle of the NV trainer and students stare at a single, fixed light for a minimum of eight to 10 seconds to experience the illusion of an erratically moving light, which is the autokinetic phenomenon. Next, the instructor turns off the single red light and turns on the outer two red lights of the trainer, and students stare between the two lights for eight to 10 seconds, causing the movement of light to increase. When there are up to four lights with little to no visual references, the illusion increases. Students learn to avoid autokinesis illusions by concentrating on a single light while maintaining it in their peripheral vision, a technique called nighttime scanning. Other anomalies the NV trainer addresses are the Purkinje shift, which is the tendency of the eye to shift toward the blue end of the color spectrum at low illumination levels as part of dark adaptation, and flash blindness. During the flash-blindness demonstration, instructors explain to aircrew and parachutists that their eyes perceive afterimages following glare exposure, which affect their vision for different lengths of time, and tell them how to compensate for these “whiteout” afterimages. Use of the unaided NV trainer in aerospace physiology classes helps aircrew and parachutists develop their inherent visual abilities to the greatest possible degree, Paez said. “Although the ability to see at night varies from person to person, experience shows that most people never learn to use their night vision efficiently,” he said. “However, proper training can markedly improve night vision ability. Night vision training improves aircrew attentiveness, scanning techniques and mental interpretation of the images within their eyes.” The training is intended for aircrews with normal but untrained night vision and is not a method of testing night vision abilities, Paez said. “A trained person with fair vision may see more at night than an untrained person with superior vision,” he said. : Lt.

Actors are always interested in audience reaction but this play is unusual. The play, by Rajiv Joseph, follows the “decades-spanning relationship of two made-for-each-other masochists who, between them, manage to slice, bloody, bruise and/or mutilate most parts of the human anatomy,” said  Schuerch’s favorite scene is when Doug vomits into a trash can to make Kayleen, who had hurled into the can herself, feel comforted.

Late-Night Cafe and Dessert Haven Black Box Will Open at Seven Dials Comic Book Store Anthony West, formerly of The Black Chapel in Wandsworth, will open a vegan dessert bar in Seven Dials  before West left the business 2018 — will open a new late-night cafe and dessert shop in Seven Dials’ comic book store Orbital Comics. The space will be called Black Box. It will open at the end of February, having been originally slated for 2/2/2020. West will continue to pull his espressos on a lever machine — the only one of its kind in the city, a limited edition release from Monaco manufacturer Conti — and serve a range of vegan desserts. West has namechecked tiramisu, brownies, and coffee kanten, a Japanese coffee jelly, with the cakes using flour from Windmill in Brixton and coffee coming from Hackney’s Dark Arts, Glasgow’s Dear Green, Bristol’s Extract Coffee, Amsterdam’s Manhattan Coffee Roasters, and Pharmacie Coffee in Brighton. West says he surveyed roasters for their approach to addressing coffee’s carbon footprint and chose those that came back to him with “a meaningful response”; he also says the shop will be focussed on being a dessert bar first, and coffee second. This is something of a departure from The Black Chapel, which West opened in Wandsworth on Hallowe’en 2014 and quickly established as one of the most singular coffee shops in London, with a winning sideline in the aforementioned vegan desserts. The new space, in Seven Dials’ Orbital comic book store,  with coffee, desserts, and comics, will be “a one stop shop for fucking around in town,” at 8b Great Newport Street, open until 9p.m., which, for a London scene whose cafes tend to close down by 6, is decidedly late-night. svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd" One of London’s Neapolitan Pizza Pioneers to Open a Vegan Restaurant at Ealing Flagship Restaurants Will Be Closed Until 31 March, Unless Boris Johnson Gets This One Right A Chaotic, Evil 2020 Saw London’s Restaurant World Set Christmas Alight on Instagram

	India’s Sundance Contender ‘Fire In The Mountains’ Sends Powerful Feminist Message (EXCLUSIVE) Catherine Steadman, one of the stars of “Downton Abbey,” and the bestselling author of “Something in the Water,” is set to make her screenwriting debut with a TV series adaptation of Jess Ryder’s psychological thriller novel “The Ex-Wife.” The plot follows newlywed Tasha, who has the perfect house, a loving husband and a beautiful little girl, but has to deal with Jen, her husband’s ex-wife who just won’t leave them alone. “We think that Catherine’s genuine talent in creating riveting stories, and her unique perspective on the process as both actor and writer will make her on-screen adaptation of Jess Ryder’s bestselling novel what thriller fans have been waiting for,” said Giuliano Papadia, CEO of BlackBox Multimedia. “Herbert and the Night Train Media team immediately showed the same passion for the project, appreciating its potential and joining us in making this stand-out TV series. Their excellent experience in navigating the demands of international audiences is perfectly aligned with our expertise in developing compelling stories and we are very excited to bring this to life together.” Night Train Media CEO Herbert L. Kloiber said: “International broadcasters and streamers want high-end, contemporary scripted content that immediately stands out in a crowded marketplace. Together with Giuliano and our outstanding creative partners at BlackBox Multimedia, we are poised to enter production on ‘The Ex-Wife’ – a compelling story based on great IP from extraordinary A-list talent, with global audience demand.” Film rights for Steadman’s “Something in the Water” have been optioned by Reese Witherspoon’s production company Hello Sunshine. Her second novel, “Mr. Nobody,” was released at the beginning of 2020 to positive reviews. She is represented by the Independent Talent Group for her acting career and the Darley Anderson Agency for her literary output.

By infusing elements of early rock ’n’ roll and classic country, The Cactus Blossoms have created a sound that surpasses time, feeling both retro and contemporary. With thoughtful lyrics and soaring harmonies, the duo shines a spotlight on the time-honored tradition of blood harmony. The brothers have appeared as guests on Garrison Keillor’s A Prairie Home Companion, Austin City Limits, and perform in Athens in between shows at Nashville’s AmericanaFest and Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion. Tickets are on sale now for all events in the Black Box Concert Series and there are two ways to save on the already low ticket price. Adult tickets purchased in advance are $15, whereas tickets purchased at the door are $20, subject to availability. Student tickets are $10 in advance or at the door. Concert-goers planning to attend two or more events can purchase a ticket package and save an additional 10%.

The seating configuration may be changed to fit the needs of a show, so seating could be in the round, proscenium or in a thrust arrangement.  As the largest theater at the Cactus Shadows Fine Arts Center, the Main Stage Theater boasts a full size stage to entertain audiences in a traditional performing arts center seating layout.  PLEASE NOTE:  This venue is sloped steeply. If you need assistance or accessible seating please note the seating towards the back of the venue (Rows M and N). 
This is stadium seating. The first level is on floor level and there are 6" stairs going up to the other levels. Accessible seating is available for purchase online. Though we have more than the required number of seats available for accessibility in the theater, we can still have times when they get tight. We ask that the floor level accessible seats be reserved for those who truly need wheelchair access or are unable to navigate a 6" step.  If you are likely to need more than the 10 seats we have available in the proscenium setup, please call us at 480-488-1981 so we can talk through your accessibility needs. Desert Foothills Theater performances are held at the Cactus Shadows Fine Arts Center, at the Holland Community Center, or perhaps another stage around the area.  Most of our regular season performances are at the Fine Arts Center. Within that building are two theaters, the Main Stage and the Black Box Theater.  
Chattanooga region COVID-19 vaccine distribution, testing information and other frequently asked questions Brothers Page Burkum and Jack Torrey founded traditional country band The Cactus Blossoms in 2009. Their music is honkytonk, retro country with a roots feel. Brothers Page Burkum and Jack Torrey, who perform as The Cactus Blossoms, are the next act in the Black Box Concert Series at Athens Arts Center, 320 N. White St., in Athens, Tenn. The country duo sings at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 15. The brothers say they cut their teeth performing well-known and obscure country songs that were popular pre-1960, partly out of curiosity and deep appreciation, but mostly because they were fun. At first listen, it is evident the duo was influenced by the Everly Brothers, but this is not a tribute act. The guys say they "weren't born in the wrong era. We just got into some music from a different era and found a way to make it our own." Their show will include music from their 2016 album, "You're Dreaming," which includes the single "Mississippi," which was featured on Showtime's "Twin Peaks" in May.

                 Douglas Rain, a Shakespeare actor who provided the eerie, calmly homicidal voice of HAL in Stanley Kubrick's  The Canadian actor died Sunday morning, according to the Stratford Festival, where Rain spent 32 seasons acting in such roles such as  's Malvolio. He was also a founding member of the company. The Winnipeg-born actor had  However, Rain's biggest mark on pop culture was less Shakespearean, but perhaps just as much a classic: as  HAL 9000, a sentient, rogue computer in a film written in collaboration with science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke and widely regarded as Kubrick's masterpiece. The American Film Institute  At first, HAL, self-described as "foolproof and incapable of error," is a sturdy member of an astronaut crew headed for Jupiter, keeping spaceship functions running smoothly and maintaining friendly if unemotional relationships with its crew mates — Dr. David Bowman, Dr. Frank Poole and three others making the journey in suspended animation. When HAL seemingly makes an error, it leads Poole and Bowman to decide to shut the computer down. But HAL goes into self-preservation mode, leading to the deaths of all the crew except Bowman, who ultimately manages to deactivate HAL. Rain's steady monotone making the events all the more unnerving.  "I remember the chill of realizing HAL's unblinking red eye could read lips. The audience learns that in a sequence that's nonverbal, a shot from HAL's point of view that zeroes in on the astronauts mouths because Kubrick wanted to tell the story not with words but with majestic, peripheral-vision-filling images."   Mondello continued, "The thing that captured the audience's imagination back then more even than a chatty computer decades before Siri and Alexa was that unnervingly, HAL had a mind of his own." When HAL is finally shut down — the computer famously singing "Daisy Bell" as Rain's sonorous voice gradually fades away. "Douglas shared many of the same qualities as Kubrick's iconic creation; precision, strength of steel, enigma and infinite intelligence, as well as a wicked sense of humor," Antoni Cimolino, artistic director of the Stratford Festival, told "He will be greatly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family," the Stratford Company   END ID="NEWSLETTER-ACQUISITION-CALLOUT-DATA" DATA-NEWSLETTER="{&QUOT;NEWSLETTERID&QUOT;:&QUOT;BREAKING-NEWS&QUOT;,&QUOT;TITLE&QUOT;:&QUOT;BREAKING NEWS ALERTS&QUOT;,&QUOT;MARKETINGHEADER&QUOT;:&QUOT;SIGN UP FOR BREAKING NEWS ALERTS&QUOT;,&QUOT;FREQUENCY&QUOT;:&QUOT;&QUOT;,&QUOT;SHORTDESCRIPTION&QUOT;:&QUOT;STAY ON TOP OF THE LATEST STORIES AND DEVELOPMENTS, SENT WHEN NEWS BREAKS.&QUOT;,&QUOT;STICKYDESCRIPTION&QUOT;:&QUOT;SIGN UP FOR BREAKING NEWS ALERTS TO STAY ON TOP OF THE LATEST STORIES AND DEVELOPMENTS.&QUOT;,&QUOT;CONTENTIMAGE&QUOT;:&QUOT;HTTPS:\/\/MEDIA.NPR.ORG\/ASSETS\/IMG\/2018\/08\/03\/NEWSLETTERS\/BREAKING_NEWS.PNG&QUOT;,&QUOT;STATICMARKUPDIR&QUOT;:&QUOT; &QUOT;,&QUOT;BRANDINGDIR&QUOT;:&QUOT; &QUOT;,&QUOT;BRANDINGLINK&QUOT;:&QUOT; &QUOT;,&QUOT;ORGANIZATIONID&QUOT;:1,&QUOT;RECAPTCHASITEKEY&QUOT;:&QUOT;6LFD6CYUAAAAAIBEUEKWZ9KCJF4UYLFTU7NWNAEK&QUOT;}"   END ID="END-OF-STORY-RECOMMENDATIONS-MOUNT" CLASS="RECOMMENDED-STORIES" ARIA-LABEL="RECOMMENDED STORIES"

A celebrated Shakespearean stage actor from Canada, he did all his work on the 1968 classic in postproduction.
 Douglas Rain, the veteran Canadian stage actor who provided the soft and gentle voice of the rogue HAL 9000 computer for Stanley Kubrick's classic  Rain died Sunday morning at St. Mary's Memorial Hospital outside Stratford, Ontario, the Stratford Festival announced.  in London, performed in a host of Shakespearean plays at the Stratford Festival and received a Tony Award nomination in 1972 for his turn opposite Claire Bloom in Robert Bolt's   script had HAL being voiced by a woman and was called Athena; afterward, it was decided that the computer should sound more like a man. Nigel Davenport, Martin Balsam and others were tried out — and ruled out — before and during filming of the 1968  "Well, we had some difficulty deciding exactly what HAL should sound like, and Marty just sounded a little bit too colloquially American, whereas Rain had the kind of bland mid-Atlantic accent we felt was right for the part," Kubrick told  Kubrick told Rain that he had made the computer "too emotional and too human." So, in late 1967, the actor flew to New York City and spent a day and a half — about 9 1/2 hours in all — to voice HAL. , Rain "did the recordings with his bare feet resting on a pillow, in order to maintain the required relaxed tone." "He's the main character of the film as far as I'm concerned," the actor, who played Cmdr. David Bowman,   in a 2016 interview. "It was brilliant casting. Something about his voice, it was perfect. It was unusual."  — like when HAL famously says, "I am sorry, Dave, I am afraid I cannot do that" — the computer was voiced by assistant director Derek  , a Brit; for scenes with Gary Lockwood, who played the astronaut Frank Poole, it was Kubrick who often supplied the lines. As Rain's HAL tells a BBC reporter in the film: "The 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made. No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. We are all, by any practical definition of the words, foolproof and incapable of error." HAL, "born" on Jan. 12, 1992, in Urbana, Illinois, also is a chess master and "enjoys working with people." /Day, wasn't as lucky when the actor declined to participate in a Super Bowl commercial about the Y2K bug.  wrote on his website in February 2017. "He was an artist, and he didn't stoop to doing commercials." Numerous reports over the years indicated that Rain also voiced another evil computer in the Woody Allen futuristic comedy  "He never spoke of this to any family members or close friends, and for those of us that know his voice well, this is not Douglas Rain speaking but another actor doing an attempted imitation of HAL’s voice," his sons, Adam and David Rain, wrote. "We are aware that there are thousands, perhaps millions of online references to him being the computer voice in  . However, there is no original source for this belief that we can find, and we do admit, it does make a very nice story." Born in 1928, Douglas Rain attended the University of Manitoba, worked in radio dramas and studied acting at the Banff School of Fine Arts in Alberta. In 1950, he left for a two-year apprenticeship at the Old Vic. Rain came home in 1953 to become a co-founding member of Stratford Shakespearean Festival. He made his Broadway bow in 1956 in  , noted a few years ago that Rain had narrated a 1960 National Film Board of Canada short film called  . An inspired Kubrick reportedly had seen that film nearly a hundred times and certainly was aware of Rain's abilities.  lines in the New York studio "with Kubrick sitting four feet across" from him. He never saw a foot of the film until he watched it in a theater months later. His long association with Stratford included star turns as another "Hal" — King Henry V — in  , which was made into a TV production in 1966; as Macbeth opposite Maggie Smith in 1978; as Shylock in  "Canadian theater has lost one of its greatest talents and a guiding light in its development," festival artistic director Antoni Cimolino said Sunday. "Douglas Rain was that rare artist — an actor deeply admired by other actors. The voice of HAL in  , Douglas shared many of the same qualities as Kubrick’s iconic creation — precision, strength of steel, enigma and infinite intelligence, as well as a wicked sense of humor. "But those of us lucky enough to have worked with Douglas soon solved his riddle and discovered that at the center of his mystery lay warmth and humanity, evidenced in his care for the young members of our profession. Douglas dedicated his talent to the stages of his native land, and we are proud in return to dedicate the coming season's production of  Rain was married to and divorced from veteran Canadian actress Martha Henry, his second wife. Survivors include his sons and a granddaughter, Salima. , but that and all of his years in front of cameras and on stages could not compete with the 9 1/2 hours he spent on  "He's a classical actor in Canada," Dullea told NPR in 2010. "This is not a quote, but I'm told that his attitude is, 'I've done Shakespeare and the classics for 50 years, and all anyone wants to talk to me about is a film that I worked on for two days.' "

When the last surviving astronaut plots to shut the renegade computer down, HAL becomes wise to it. RAIN: (As HAL 9000) This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it. I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.

HAL 9000, the seemingly omniscient computer in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” was the film’s most expressive and emotional figure, and made a lasting impression on our collective imagination. Stanley Kubrick’s epic, a journey from pre-human history to a possible infinity that doesn’t need humans at all, is probably the most respected, if not the most beloved, science-fiction film of all time. The story of the creation of HAL’s performance — the result of a last-minute collaboration between the idiosyncratic director Stanley Kubrick and the veteran Canadian actor Douglas Rain — has been somewhat lost in the 50 years since the film’s release in April 1968. As has its impact: Artificial intelligence has borrowed from the HAL persona, and now, unwittingly, a slight hint of Canadianness resides in our phones and interactive devices. Mr. Rain’s HAL has become the default reference, not just for the voice, but also for the humanesque qualities of what a sentient machine’s personality should be. Just ask Amazon’s Alexa or Google Home — the cadence, the friendly formality, the pleasant intelligence and sense of calm control in their voices evoke Mr. Rain’s unforgettable performance. As we warily eye a future utterly transformed by A.I. incursions into all aspects of our lives, HAL has been lurking. : How Voice Activates and Advances the Human-Computer Relationship,” HAL 9000 is a mix between a butler and a psychoanalyst. “He has a sense of deference and of detachment,” Mr. Brave said, adding that he saw a ripple effect on, for example, the iPhone’s virtual assistant. “When I listen to something like Siri I feel there is a lot in common.” Even when Kubrick was making the film, the director sensed HAL’s larger implications. He said   with the author and critic Joseph Gelmis that one of the things he was trying to convey was “the reality of a world populated — as ours soon will be — by machine entities that have as much, or more, intelligence as human beings. We wanted to stimulate people to think what it would be like to share a planet with such creatures.” The “2001” historian David Larson said that “Kubrick came up with the final HAL voice very late in the process. It was determined during ‘2001’ planning that in the future the large majority of computer command and communication inputs would be via voice, rather than via typewriter.” But artificial intelligence was decades from a convincing facsimile of a human voice — and who was to say how a computer should sound anyway? , who had won the best supporting actor Oscar for “A Thousand Clowns.” Perhaps there was a satisfying echo that appealed to Kubrick — both were from the Bronx and sounded like it. In August 1966, Balsam told a journalist: “I’m not actually seen in the picture at any time, but I sure create a lot of excitement projecting my voice through that machine. And I’m getting an Academy Award winner price for doing it, too.” Adam Balsam, the actor’s son, told me that “Kubrick had him record it very realistically and humanly, complete with crying during the scene when HAL’s memory is being removed.” Then the director changed his mind. “We had some difficulty deciding exactly what HAL should sound like, and Marty just sounded a little bit too colloquially American,” Kubrick said in the 1969 interview. Mr. Rain recalls Kubrick telling him, “I’m having trouble with what I’ve got in the can. Would you play the computer?” Kubrick had heard Mr. Rain’s voice in the 1960 documentary “Universe,” a film he watched at least 95 times, according to the actor. “I think he’s perfect,” Kubrick wrote to a colleague in a letter preserved in the director’s archive. “The voice is neither patronizing, nor is it intimidating, nor is it pompous, overly dramatic or actorish. Despite this, it is interesting.” In December 1967, Kubrick and Mr. Rain met at a recording studio at the MGM lot in Borehamwood, outside London. The actor hadn’t seen a frame of the film, then still deep in postproduction. He met none of his co-stars, not even Keir Dullea, who played the astronaut David Bowman, HAL’s colleague turned nemesis. The cast members had long since completed their work, getting HAL’s lines fed to them by a range of people, including the actress Stefanie Powers. Mr. Rain hadn’t even been hired to play HAL, but to provide narration. Kubrick finally decided against using narration, opting for the ambiguity that was enraging to some viewers, transcendent to others. It’s not a session Mr. Rain remembers fondly: “If you could have been a ghost at the recording you would have thought it was a load of rubbish.” Kubrick was attracted to Mr. Rain for the role partly because the actor “had the kind of bland mid-Atlantic accent we felt was right for the part,” he said in the 1969 interview with Mr. Gelmis. But Mr. Rain’s accent isn’t mid-Atlantic at all; it’s Standard Canadian English. As the University of Toronto linguistics professor Jack Chambers explained: “You have to have a computer that sounds like he’s from nowhere, or, rather, from no specific place. Standard Canadian English sounds ‘normal’ — that’s why Canadians are well received in the United States as anchormen and reporters, because the vowels don’t give away the region they come from.” Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece turned 50 on Tuesday. To celebrate, we’ve compiled a list of our favorite references from the pop culture of the last half-century. Mr. Rain had played an astonishing range of characters in almost 80 productions at the Stratford Festival in Ontario over 45 years, understudying Alec Guinness in “Richard III” in 1953 and going on to play Macbeth, King Lear and Humpty Dumpty. Sexy, intimidating, folksy, sly or persuasive, he could deliver whatever a role needed. Mr. Rain had to quickly fathom and flesh out HAL, recording all of his lines in 10 hours over two days. Kubrick sat “three feet away, explaining the scenes to me and reading all the parts.” Though HAL has ice water in his digital veins, he exudes a dry wit and superciliousness that makes me wonder why someone would deliberately program a computer to talk this way. Maybe we should worry about A.I. When HAL says, “I know I’ve made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal,” Mr. Rain somehow manages to sound both sincere and not reassuring. And his delivery of the line “I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do” has the sarcastic drip of a drawing-room melodrama and also carries the disinterested vibe of a polite sociopath. Kubrick had Mr. Rain sing the 1892 love song “Daisy Bell” (“I’m half crazy, all for the love of you”) almost 50 times, in uneven tempos, in monotone, at different pitches and even just by humming it. In the end, he used the very first take. Sung as HAL’s brain is being disconnected, it’s from his early programming days, his computer childhood. It brings to an end the most affecting scene in the entire film. Scott Brave said the moment “is so powerful that you feel very uncomfortable; all of sudden HAL feels incredibly close to being alive and being human. You start to empathize with that experience, and you are responding to the death of a machine.” For a character that’s been endlessly caricatured — in “The Simpsons,” “South Park,” television commercials — HAL has inspired a surprisingly rich range of adjectives over the years. He and his voice have been described as aloof, eerily neutral, silky, wheedling, controlled, baleful, unisex, droll, soft, conversational, dreamy, supremely calm and rational. He’s discursive, suave, inhumanly cool, confident, superior, deadpan, sinister, patronizing and asexual. Anthony Hopkins has said it influenced his performance as the serial killer Hannibal Lecter in “The Silence of the Lambs.” Douglas Rain himself has never seen “2001: A Space Odyssey.” For the retired actor who spent decades at the Stratford Festival and turns 90 in May, the performance was simply a job. A.I. voice synthesis can’t yet deliver a performance as compelling as his HAL, but it is becoming more … human. The HAL era is almost over: Soon, an A.I. voice will be able to sound like whoever you want it to. In Canada, even Alexa has a Canadian accent.

                Americans are more tolerant of free speech than other nationalities, according to Pew research
               Where do you draw the line between freedom of speech and offensive comments? It’s an ongoing debate. In the wake of the advent of social media the debate has got even louder. People saying what they want gives the bosses of Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites a big headache.  But saying what you like is more accepted in the United States than anywhere else, according to recent research. The Pew Research Center polled 38 countries around the world in 2015 and found that   nationalities.

            Which are the most important human rights? Depends on where you're from
 Seventy-one percent of Americans think that people should be able to say what they want without state or government censorship, 67% think that the media should report the news without this infringement, and 69% think people should be able to use the internet however they want without the authorities getting involved.  The figures are similar for America’s southern neighbours: 69% of Latin Americans think that they should be able to say what they want, 71% – more than the US – think that the press should be able to say what it wants, and 61% think that they should be able to use the internet as they see fit.  As the chart below shows, Europe was the third most likely region to support freedom of speech, followed by Asia Pacific, Africa and the Middle East the least likely.

They then calculated a median score for each country. The US registered the highest score, at 5.73. Poland was the second most tolerant country, registering a median score of 5.66. Spain and the United Kingdom were the only other European countries to feature in the 10 most tolerant, at 5.62 and 4.78 respectively.  Other particularly tolerant countries include Mexico (5.40), Venezuela (5.17), Canada (5.08), Australia (4.94) and South Africa (4.80).  The country that was least supportive of free expression was Senegal, with a median score of 2.06. Burkina Faso, with 2.94, was the only other African country to appear in the bottom 10. Other countries with a low tolerance of freedom of expression were Jordan (2.53), Pakistan (2.78), Ukraine (2.85), Vietnam (2.96), Lebanon (3.16) and Japan (3.27). It’s worth remembering that freedom of speech is enshrined in the constitution of the United States – the first amendment offers protection of public speech.

The sentence for committing these crimes could theoretically be imprisonment, but during the modern juridical history the sentence has always been a fine.
 The hate speech law is relatively lax.

The organization also criticized the country for its prosecutive record of "contempt for public officials" in France, including the BDS case and another in 2019 where two defendants were convicted for burning an effigy of Macron. It argued that such selectivity is to cover up other laicist violations of freedom of speech, like prohibiting Muslims from wearing religious symbols in schools and public sector jobs. , which also states that there is no censorship and that freedom of expression may be limited by law.

However the article qualifies this right, providing that it may not be used to undermine "public order or morality or the authority of the State". Furthermore, the constitution explicitly requires that the publication of "seditious, or indecent matter" be a criminal offence. This led to the government passing blasphemy legislation on 8 July 2009. However, in May 2018 there was a referendum which removed the word "blasphemous" from the constitution. The scope of the protection afforded by this Article has been interpreted restrictively by the judiciary, largely as a result of the wording of the Article, which qualifies the right before articulating it. Indeed, until an authoritative pronouncement on the issue by the Supreme Court, many believed that the protection was restricted to "convictions and opinions" and, as a result, a separate right to communicate was, by necessity, implied into Article 40.3.2.

The second paragraph says that radio and television will be regulated by law, but that there will be no prior censorship dealing with the content of broadcasts. The third paragraph grants a similar freedom of speech as in the first for other means of making ideas and feelings public, but allowing censorship for reasons of decency when the public that has access may be younger than sixteen years of age. The fourth and last paragraph exempts commercial advertising from the freedoms granted in the first three paragraphs. The penal code does have laws sanctioning certain types of expression. Such laws and freedom of speech were at the centre of a public debate in The Netherlands after the arrest on 16 May 2008 of cartoonist Gregorius Nekschot.

The law regulating TV and radio broadcasts had previously expressly prohibited discrimination against advertisers, granting a rejected advertiser the right to complain to a national board.

 Various aspects of the contemporary press freedom situation are criticized by multiple international organizations.  The Russian constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, however, government application of   constraining its coverage of certain controversial issues, resulting in infringements of these rights. , the Russian government exerts control over civil society through selective implementation of the law, restriction and censure. The 2002 Federal Law on Counteracting Extremist Activity codifies a definition of "extremism", prohibits advocacy of extreme political positions, imposes liability on organizations that do not disavow the "extremist" statements of their members, and allows government authorities to suspend, without court order, social and religious organizations and political parties.  In 2014, Russia strengthened criminal responsibility for crimes under Art. 280 ("public calls for extremist activity"), Art. 282 ("inciting hatred or hostility, and humiliation of human dignity"), Art. 282 Part 1 ("the organization of an extremist community") and Art. 282 Part 2 ("the organization of an extremist organization") of the Criminal Code.  Under the strengthened laws, those convicted of "extremist activity" face up to six years in prison.  also guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of information for every citizen (Article 16).  But still the country makes some controversial decisions, which both human right organizations and other states criticize. The Swiss animal rights organization   took the country to the European Court of Human Rights twice for censoring a TV ad of the organization, in which the livestock farming of pigs is shown. The organization won both lawsuits, and the Swiss state was convicted to pay compensations. The Swiss held a referendum which made it into law on making it illegal to express a hateful or biased opinion towards the LGBT community, with up to 3 years imprisonment for would be offenders, the country voted 60-40 for it.

UK defamation law may have experienced a considerable liberalising effect as a result of the ruling in  , in which journalism undertaken in the public interest shall enjoy a complete defence against a libel suit. Conditions for the defence include the right of reply for potential claimants, and that the balance of the piece was fair in view of what the writer knew at the time. The ruling removed the awkward—and hitherto binding—conditions of being able to describe the publisher as being under a duty to publish the material and the public as having a definite interest in receiving it.

There are no set regulations as to what cannot be depicted in order to gain a classification as each scene is considered in the context of the wider intentions of the work; however images that could aid, encourage, or are a result of the committing of a crime, along with sustained and graphic images of torture or sexual abuse are the most likely to be refused. The objectionable material may be cut by the distributor in order to receive a classification, but with some works it may be deemed that no amount of cuts would be able to make the work suitable for classification, effectively banning that title from sale in the country. Cinemas by convention use BBFC classifications, but recordings refused a classification by the BBFC may still be shown in   providing the local authority, from which a cinema must have a licence to operate, will permit them.

Section 319 of the Code makes it an offence to publicly incite hatred against people based on the same list of personal characteristics from s. 318, except where the statements made are true or are made in good faith. , the Supreme Court by a 4-3 decision upheld the offence of publicly inciting hatred, finding that while it infringes the guarantee of freedom of expression, it is a reasonable limit and justifiable under s. 1 of the Charter. When originally enacted, the list of protected personal grounds in s. 318 did not include sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. Sexual orientation was added to the list in 2004, when Parliament passed   In 2017, Parliament added gender identity and gender expression to the list of protected personal grounds in s. 318 by  . The Court struck down a provision in the Criminal Code that prohibited publication of false information or news, stating that it violated section 2(b) of the Charter and could not be justified under s. 1. Canada has had a string of high-profile court cases in which writers and publishers have been the targets of human rights complaints for their writings, in both magazines and web postings.  The human rights process in Canada is civil in nature, not criminal. Citizens have freedom of speech and of the press in keeping with the objectives of socialist society. Material conditions for the exercise of that right are provided by the fact that the press, radio, television, movies and other organs of the mass media are State or social property and can never be private property. This assures their use at the exclusive service of the working people and in the interest of society.
The law regulates the exercise of these freedoms. The rights of assembly, demonstration and association are exercised by workers, both manual and intellectual; peasants; women; students; and other sectors of the working people, [rights] to which they have the necessary ability (los medios necesarios) to exercise. The social and mass organizations have all the facilities they need to carry out those activities in which the members have full freedom of speech and opinion based on the unlimited right of initiative and criticism.

This does not affect movie distribution via physical tapes or discs, cable TV, or the Internet. Since 2000, it has become quite common for movie studios to release "unrated" versions of films on DVD, containing content that had been removed from the theatrical version in order to get a satisfactory MPAA rating.
 Unlike what has been called a strong international consensus that hate speech needs to be prohibited by law and that such prohibitions override, or are irrelevant to, guarantees of freedom of expression, the United States is perhaps unique among the developed world in that under law, some hate speech is protected. For instance, in July 2012 a U.S. court ruled that advertisements with the slogan, "In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man, Support Israel, Defeat Jihad", are constitutionally protected speech and the government must allow their display in   approved new guidelines for subway advertisements, as prohibiting those that it "reasonably foresees would imminently incite or provoke violence or other immediate breach of the peace".

2. Publics satisfied with free speech, ability to improve living standards; many are critical of institutions, politicians A median of 62% say their country is one where the rights of people to express their views in public are protected. When asked about a number of different statements that describe their country, this ranks as one of the first or second most cited in two-thirds of the countries surveyed. Publics are also optimistic that most people have a good chance to improve their standard of living: A median of 57% say this is feasible in their countries. Most also feel relatively safe; in a majority of countries, only small shares of the public say most people in their country live in areas where it is dangerous to walk around at night. When it comes to political institutions, however, publics are more critical. A median of six-in-ten think no matter who wins an election, things do not change very much. This sentiment is particularly prevalent in Europe; seven of the 10 European countries surveyed say this describes their country more than most other statements presented to them. People are somewhat more critical of their courts: A median of 44% share the opinion that the court system in their country treats everyone fairly, whereas a median of 53% say this does not describe their country well. People are also skeptical of their politicians. Across the 27 countries surveyed, 54% think most politicians in their country are corrupt. And only 35% agree that elected officials care what ordinary people think. By and large, supporters of the governing party or coalition are more inclined to say elected officials care what ordinary people think, freedom of expression is protected, and most people can better their standard of living. Those who support the governing party or coalition are also less likely to describe politicians in their country as corrupt in seven countries. A 27-country median of 62% say their country protects freedom of expression. This sense is somewhat more prevalent in advanced than emerging economies (a median of 68% vs. 58%, respectively). Across the North American and European nations surveyed, around half or more in most countries say their nation is one in which people can express their views in public. The sense that freedom of speech is protected is also widespread in the two Middle Eastern countries surveyed, as well as across the Asia-Pacific region. But, across the 27 nations, few say this describes their country  Only in Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Italy and Mexico do about half or more say this statement does not describe their country well. In Brazil, roughly four-in-ten (39%) say this does not describe their country well  Across most European countries surveyed, those who have favorable opinions of populist parties are significantly less likely to feel their country is one in which freedom of expression is protected. Take Sweden as an example: Those who have a favorable opinion of the Sweden Democrats are 30 percentage points less likely to think free speech is protected in their country than those who do not favor this party. Publics generally say their countries are ones in which there are opportunities to improve living standards. A median of 57% across the 27 nations surveyed agree most people have a good chance to improve their own standard of living, including majorities in 16 of the 27 nations surveyed. This sentiment is slightly more widespread in the nine emerging economies surveyed (median of 62%) than in the 18 advanced economies (55%). Filipinos, South Africans and Nigerians are especially likely to describe their countries as ones in which people can improve their economic situation; about four-in-ten or more in each country say this describes their country  But in Italy, Spain and Greece, only about one-quarter of people say their country is one in which it is possible to improve their standard of living, with around four-in-ten in Spain (41%) saying this does not describe their country well  In all of the nations surveyed, the belief that people can get ahead economically is closely related to views about whether their country’s economy has   20 years. Those who think the economic situation has gotten better are more likely to say most people in their country have the opportunity to advance their standard of living. For example, 69% of French people who think the economic situation today is better for the average person than it was in the past also say it is possible to improve their standard of living, compared with 33% among those who say the economic situation today is worse than it was 20 years ago. In most countries polled, people with positive assessments of their country’s current economic situation are also more likely to say that most people have a good chance to advance their standard of living. In nine of the 27 nations, those ages 18 to 29 are more likely than those ages 50 and older to say people can improve their standard of living. For example, younger Germans are 21 percentage points more likely than older Germans to describe their country as a place where most have opportunities to better their standard of living. Three countries stand out for the relative pessimism of the younger generation. In the U.S., South Korea and Tunisia, those under 30 are less likely than the oldest cohort to say their country is one in which people can improve their economic situation. In Tunisia, for example, 53% of those ages 50 and older are positive about the potential for people in their country to improve their standard of living compared with 39% of those 18 to 29. A 27-nation median of 44% say the statement “the court system treats everyone fairly” describes their country well, while a median of 53% say it does not. And opinions about a country’s court system vary little across the advanced and emerging economies surveyed. Indonesians are particularly likely to say their courts are impartial; around three-quarters say the court system treats everyone fairly (74%), including around four-in-ten (38%) who say this describes their country   well. Views on the impartiality of the courts are also shared in the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Canada, the Philippines and Kenya, where roughly six-in-ten or more say this describes their country well. Publics in Italy, Spain, South Korea and Argentina are less confident in the fairness of their court systems: Only around one-in-five in each of these nations say the courts treat everyone fairly. Roughly half or more in Argentina, Brazil, Spain and Mexico say this statement does not describe their country well  In 20 of the 27 countries surveyed, around half or more say that the statement “elected officials care what ordinary people think” does not describe their country well. Nine-in-ten Greeks agree the statement does not describe their country well, and upwards of around eight-in-ten say the same in Brazil, Spain and Argentina. Publics in these four countries also have high percentages who feel strongly about this: 62% of Brazilians, 57% of Greeks, 54% of Argentines and 48% of Spaniards say the statement does not describe their country well  agree elected officials in their country care what ordinary people think, Indonesia and the Philippines stand out. In both countries, around seven-in-ten or more describe their country as one in which elected officials care about the people, including three-in-ten or more in each who say this describes their country  Publics in the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden and Kenya are also somewhat sanguine about elected officials caring about the citizens in their country.  of the concept are that “the people” and “the elite” are two antagonistic groups and that the people’s will should provide the main source of government legitimacy. And, in four countries – the Netherlands, Hungary, Germany and Sweden – people with favorable views of populist parties are indeed less likely to say elected officials care what ordinary people think than those who view these parties unfavorably. For example, those with favorable views of the Sweden Democrats are 26 percentage points less likely than Swedes with unfavorable opinions of the party to describe elected officials as caring about ordinary people. But, in Italy, where the populist parties Northern League and the Five Star Movement are currently governing, the relationship is reversed.  likely to say elected officials in their country care what ordinary people think. In 18 of the 27 countries surveyed, around half or more say their country can be described as one in which most politicians are corrupt. In many European nations, roughly half or more say they live in a country in which the statement “most politicians are corrupt” describes their country well. Majorities also share this opinion in the U.S., as well as the two Middle Eastern and three sub-Saharan African countries surveyed. Opinion is more divided in the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. Greeks are the most likely to describe their politicians as corrupt (89%), while around three-quarters or more in Russia, South Korea, Nigeria and South Africa describe their country in a similar manner. Publics in Sweden, the Netherlands, Indonesia, Mexico and Germany are the least likely to say their country can be described as one in which most politicians are corrupt. In many of the 27 countries surveyed, there are educational divides on whether most politicians in the country can be described as corrupt. Particularly in emerging and developing economies, people with higher levels of education are more likely to say most politicians are corrupt. For example, Brazilians with more education are 27 percentage points more likely than those with less education to describe politicians in the country as corrupt. But, in six countries – all of which are advanced economies – the pattern is reversed; people with less education are more likely to describe politicians as corrupt. Take Germany as an example: Germans with less than a postsecondary degree are 17 points more likely to say most politicians in their country are corrupt than Germans with more education. Those with favorable opinions of populist parties in five European countries (the PVV in the Netherlands, AfD in Germany, Jobbik in Hungary, Sweden Democrats in Sweden and UKIP in the United Kingdom) are more likely than those with unfavorable opinions of these parties to say most politicians in their country are corrupt.  is that, after an election, parties and policies in the country may change. But many global publics say this doesn’t describe what happens in their countries following an election. A 27-country median of 60% say no matter who wins an election, things don’t change very much. Greeks are the most likely to describe their country as one where things do not change very much no matter who wins an election (82%), followed by Australians (75%), Russians (72%) and Tunisians (67%). And, in Tunisia and Greece, more than half say this statement describes their country  It is worth noting that whether or not things change a lot following an election could be interpreted as either a positive or a negative characteristic of democracy. For some, no change after an election may be a good thing, whereas for others it may be bad. A median of 35% believe most people live in areas where it’s dangerous to walk around at night. But opinion diverges somewhat across advanced and emerging economies. In advanced economies, a median of only 30% say most people live in areas where it is dangerous to walk around at night, compared with a median of 45% across the nine emerging economies surveyed. Around six-in-ten or more in Greece, Tunisia, South Africa, Nigeria and Argentina describe their country as one in which most people live in areas where it is dangerous to walk around at night, including roughly half or more in Tunisia and South Africa who say this describes their country   well. But, across most European, Asia-Pacific and North American countries surveyed, people largely agree this statement does not describe their country well. There are also marked differences in people’s assessments based on income levels. In four emerging economies – India, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico – those with higher incomes are more likely than those with lower incomes to describe their country as one in which most people live in areas where it is dangerous to walk around at night. In India, though, those with lower incomes are also less likely to answer the question. In most advanced economies, the pattern reverses. Those with lower incomes are more likely to believe it is dangerous to walk around at night. For example, less affluent Australians are 20 percentage points more likely to say most people live in dangerous areas. Educational gaps follow a similar pattern. In many advanced economies, those with lower levels of education are somewhat more likely to describe their country as dangerous to walk around in at night. For example, in Germany, there is a 25-point gap between those with lower levels of education and those with a postsecondary degree or above (39% vs. 14%). But, in three of the emerging economies – Brazil, India and Indonesia – those with higher educational attainment are more likely to say many people live in dangerous areas. In eight countries, women are more likely than men to describe their country as one in which it is dangerous to walk around at night. In South Korea, for example, women are 12 percentage points more likely than men to express this opinion.

The recent appearance of a controversial speaker at Georgetown University, where I’m a student, bubbled over into a communitywide debate that pitted the social merits of free speech against the harm of hate speech. , appeared at a forum sponsored by the Georgetown University College Republicans, or GUCR, to promote her new book. The event   on campus, as many progressive students condemned the GUCR for giving Darwish a platform to spew her hateful views. The controversy even prompted a member of the GUCR board  Despite angry protests, however, the event proceeded and Darwish spoke. But the controversy didn’t remain confined to campus.   media chimed in to attack pro-Muslim students for protesting. To be honest, I was surprised that what seemed to only be important to students at my school mushroomed into a much larger issue and received such attention. However, I now understand that what happened at Georgetown serves as just one example of many similar conversations occurring at universities across the country. I do not believe that colleges should censor all hate speech by individuals, but expending university resources to invite and actively promote a speaker of hate is wrong. Universities should not censor any individual’s speech, but they should acknowledge the roots of biases. Officials with the  Bigoted speech is symptomatic of a huge problem in our country; it is not the problem itself. Everybody, when they come to college, brings with them the values, biases and assumptions they learned while growing up in society, so it’s unrealistic to think that punishing speech is going to rid campuses of the attitudes that gave rise to the speech in the first place. Banning bigoted speech won’t end bigotry, even if it might chill some of the crudest expressions. The mindset that produced the speech lives on and may even reassert itself in more virulent forms. While individual speech should be protected, however, university-sponsored speaker events differ from individual rights of free expression. Universities should be cognizant of not expending their resources on individuals who discriminate against members of their student bodies and encompass the antithesis of diversity, tolerance, and acceptance. After all, if universities serve to enrich the minds of society’s young people, then how would a speaker of hate benefit anyone’s education? In addition to the protest at Georgetown, recent protests regarding controversial speakers have occurred at the  , among others. In each case, news stories highlight an ongoing public debate that pits free speech against hate speech. Even politicians have joined in the arguments, with some conservatives waging a war on so-called  . They state that those who protest hate speech are ultimately promoting censorship as a means of controlling and avoiding speech with which they do not agree—speech that is free under the Constitution. The idea of censorship is troubling, but painting the anti-hate speech movement as part of an attempt to ignore reality avoids its nuance. Confronting hate speech is not about controlling the conversation but rather about promoting tolerance and inclusivity. And contrary to the sensationalized attention that the issue receives in the media, most college students do not feel that the anti-hate movement puts their right to free speech under attack.  by Gallup, the Knight Foundation, and the Newseum Institute found that 73 percent of college students think that their right to free speech is “very secure or secure.” Moreover, a majority—71 percent—of students believe that policies universities have adopted “to discourage speech and behavior that could be seen as offensive or insensitive toward certain groups” have “been about right.” Interestingly, 41 percent of black students felt that their college had “not gone far enough,” while only 15 percent of white students agreed. This gap shows that black students likely feel more of an impact when colleges work to prevent hateful expressions, such as racial slurs. The anti-hate speech movement seeks to help these students. While I don’t advocate for policies that restrict individuals’ rights of free speech, the underlying theme of these policies—when applied to university-sponsored events—demonstrates a goal of compassion and understanding. Hate speech, when actively promoted by a university, is outside the bounds of free speech and should therefore exist beyond political sides. On the other hand, both sides should be wary of censorship. Unfortunately, however, the issue of speech on college campuses has become politicized and exaggerated. Students who protest university-sponsored events that they view are promoting hateful speech are often criticized for being unwilling to hear the other side’s opinion. The idea that students work to suppress the views of others ironically works to delegitimize those students’ views and concerns in favor of perpetuating the problems of racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and Islamophobia. There is no gold standard for distinguishing between hate speech and difference of opinion. Healthy, productive discussions are necessary to foster growth, tolerance, and understanding. Universities should try more to invite speakers who bring opinions that do not ostracize groups of people or religions but instead provide rational arguments based in truth. It is important that universities do not censor individuals’ speech—even if some may consider that speech offensive. But it isn’t conducive to learning for a university to actively promote and support bigoted ideas by inviting speakers known for their hateful, unsubstantiated views. I question why the GUCR chose to invite someone without any academic credentials on her subject but known for her anti-Islam views. And I further wonder why the group chose to continue with its event after Muslim students and their allies pleaded against it. Perhaps the greatest challenge in issues such as this is how often the line between free speech and hate speech gets blurred. But by considering the debate in two different lights—one being censorship and the other being university-promoted speech—as well as by depoliticizing the issue, an attitude of empathy can be possible. Critics of protesters’ pleas should step back and evaluate the roots of students’ grievances and the roots of the hateful opinions rather than delegitimize students’ concerns and desire for safe, welcoming environments. Why must there be a free speech and hate speech side? Why can’t there simply be respect? Empathy for these very real feelings can make Georgetown and other universities what they should be—positive places for all students to debate and learn respectfully.

UNESCO Website is currently under maintenance. We are working very hard and the service will be back very shortly. UNESCO is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. It seeks to build peace through international cooperation in Education, the Sciences and Culture. Political and economic arrangements of governments are not enough to secure the lasting and sincere support of the peoples. Peace must be founded upon dialogue and mutual understanding. Peace must be built upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of humanity.
                 In this spirit, UNESCO develops educational tools to help people live as global citizens free of hate and intolerance. UNESCO works so that each child and citizen has access to quality education. By promoting cultural heritage and the equal dignity of all cultures, UNESCO strengthens bonds among nations. UNESCO fosters scientific programmes and policies as platforms for development and cooperation. UNESCO stands up for freedom of expression, as a fundamental right and a key condition for democracy and development. Serving as a laboratory of ideas, UNESCO helps countries adopt international standards and manages programmes that foster the free flow of ideas and knowledge sharing.
                 UNESCO's founding vision was born in response to a world war that was marked by racist and anti-Semitic violence. Seventy years on and many liberation struggles later, UNESCO’s mandate is as relevant as ever. Cultural diversity is under attack and new forms of intolerance, rejection of scientific facts and threats to freedom of expression challenge peace and human rights. In response, UNESCO's duty remains to reaffirm the humanist missions of education, science and culture.  real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups  
Your voice matters. You have the right to say what you think, share information and demand a better world. You also have the right to agree or disagree with those in power, and to express these opinions in peaceful protests.  Exercising these rights - without fear or unlawful interference - is central to living in an open and fair society; one in which people can access justice and enjoy their human rights. Yet governments around the world routinely imprison people – or worse – for speaking out, even though almost every country’s constitution refers to the value of ‘free speech’. Governments have a duty to prohibit hateful, inciteful speech but many abuse their authority to silence peaceful dissent by passing laws criminalising freedom of expression. This is often done in the name of counter-terrorism, national security or religion. More recently, freedom of expression has come under threat by authorities clamping down on activists, NGOs and individuals helping refugees and migrants. How governments tolerate unfavourable views or critical voices is often a good indication of how they treat human rights generally. Amnesty International supports people who speak out peacefully for themselves and for others – whether a journalist reporting on violence by security forces, a trade unionist exposing poor working conditions or an indigenous leader defending their land rights against big business. We would similarly defend the right of those who support the positions of big business, the security forces and employers to express their views peacefully. We consider anyone put in prison solely for exercising their right to free speech peacefully to be a prisoner of conscience and call for their immediate and unconditional release. Police violently disperse a spontaneous protest in Tverskaya street after the verdict in the Bolotnaya case was delivered, Moscow, February 2014. © Alexander Baroshin / Amnesty International The right to freedom of expression is enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which sets out in broad terms the human rights that each of us has. It was later protected legally by a raft of international and regional treaties. Defending freedom of expression has always been a core part of Amnesty International’s work and is vital in holding the powerful to account. Freedom of expression also underpins other human rights such as the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion - and allows them to flourish. It is also closely linked to freedom of association - the right to  form and join clubs, societies, trade unions or political parties with anyone you choose; and freedom of peaceful assembly - the right to take part in a peaceful demonstration or public meeting. However, these very freedoms come under regular attack by governments that want to stifle criticism.  it is currently extremely dangerous to criticize the government. Over the course of 2018, the authorities arrested at least 113 individuals citing a host of absurd reasons including satire, tweeting, supporting football clubs, denouncing sexual harassment, editing movies and giving interviews. Those arrested have been accused of “membership of terrorist groups” and “disseminating false news”. Detained without trial for months, those who eventually faced trial were sentenced by military courts, even though military trials of civilians, in Egypt as elsewhere, are inherently unfair. A free press reporting on the issues that interest us and shape our lives is a key building block of any rights-respecting society. Yet in Azerbaijan, Turkey and Venezuela to name just a few countries, journalists face repression and attacks.  fast-tracked the passing of the Written Laws Bill, which would entrench censorship, among other violations. Journalists in the country already operate within the tight confines of a media law that requires media houses to “broadcast or publish news or issues of national importance as government may direct”.   , the executive editor of online news outlet Rappler. Ressa, a prominent critic of President Rodrigo Duterte, was arrested in February 2019 on trumped up libel charges after Rappler published detailed investigations into some of the thousands of extrajudicial executions committed by police and unknown armed persons, with Duterte’s explicit encouragement, during drugs-related operations. Her case is widely seen as an attack by the government on press freedom.  where journalists investigating the killing of Rohingya men and boys by security forces in Rakhine State were arrested and jailed, before being freed under international pressure. Freedom of speech, or freedom of expression, applies to ideas of all kinds, including those that may be deeply offensive. While international law protects free speech, there are instances where speech can legitimately restricted under the same law – such as when it violates the rights of others, or, advocates hatred and incites discrimination or violence. However, any restrictions on freedom of expression must be provided by law, protect certain public interests or the rights of others and, be clearly necessary for that purpose. . , often with little accountability. Instead of the platform being a place where women can express themselves freely and where their voices are strengthened, Twitter leads women to self-censor what they post and limit their interactions. As a company, Twitter is failing its responsibility to respect women’s rights online by inadequately investigating and responding to reports of violence and abuse in a transparent manner. The digital world gives many more of us access to the information we need, including to challenge governments and corporations. Information is power and the internet has the potential to significantly empower the world’s seven billion people. But freedom of expression today still often depends on wealth, privilege and our place in society. Those who are rich and powerful are seldom restricted in expressing their views.. Similarly, those who have their own laptops with broadband, have far greater access to information than those who have to walk miles to an internet café. Increasingly, some states try to build firewalls around digital communications, or in the case of Egypt, Sudan and Zimbabwe among others, respond to mass street protests with an internet shutdown. Iran, China and Viet Nam have all tried to develop systems that enable them to control access to digital information. In India’s northern Kashmir region, mobile Internet and communications are suspended in response to any unrest. At Amnesty International, we are continually finding new ways to stop our website being blocked in China. Governments are also using dangerous and sophisticated technologies to read activists and journalists’ private emails and remotely turn on their computers’ camera or microphone to secretly record their activities. In 2014, Amnesty and a coalition of human rights and technology organizations launched ‘ ’ - a simple tool that allows activists to scan their devices for surveillance spyware.  have taken to the streets to express their opinions despite restrictive legislation combined with heavy-handed policing, surveillance, harassment and prosecution which threaten to strangle the right to peaceful protest. Since 2016, tens of thousands of people have protested against repressive legislation aimed at curbing women’s rights and undermining the independence of the judiciary. Protesters have routinely been met with a show of force and restrictive measures that infringe their right to be seen and heard. Hundreds have found themselves in police custody and facing lengthy court proceedings. In parallel with tightening the laws affecting the exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, the government has vastly expanded the surveillance powers of law enforcement agencies with evidence that these expanded powers have been used against people engaged in organizing and participating in peaceful protests. Amnesty released shocking research showing that the number of prisoners of conscience unjustly jailed across   had sharply risen by a third in signs of a growing crackdown on peaceful activism by lawyers, bloggers, human rights defenders, environmental activists and pro-democracy campaigners. The prisoners’ detention conditions remain appalling with evidence of people being tortured and otherwise ill-treated, routinely held incommunicado and in solitary confinement, kept in squalid conditions and denied medical care, clean water and fresh air. Many prisoners of conscience were jailed for comments made on social media platforms and were targeted using the vague and overly broad provisions of the penal code. One prisoner of conscience is Tran Hoang Phuc. A pro-democracy and environmental activist, he was arrested in June 2017. Tried and convicted on charges of ‘conducting propaganda against the state’ for making and sharing videos perceived to be critical of the government on social media, he was sentenced to six years in prison, followed by four years under house arrest. Freedom of Expression is protected by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The Sedition Act of 1798 criminalized the “writing, printing, uttering or publishing [of] any false, scandalous and malicious writing or writings about the government of the United States.” Lyon was sentenced to four months in jail. While imprisoned, he was elected to represent Vermont in Congress. (Image via  Prominent Democratic politician Clement L.

The government committed perhaps the greatest civil liberties violation in the history of the country since slavery — the internment of 110,000 Japanese-Americans in concentration camps.

    Reclaiming Free Speech for Democracy and Human Rights in a Digitally Networked World
   Democracies across the world are struggling with how to counter disinformation and extremism without compromising citizens’ freedom of expression and other human rights. The problem of protecting free speech in relation to other rights is not new to the internet age. For the past century, American universities have grappled with the challenge of protecting free speech while also upholding core values of social justice, inclusion, and tolerance. lessons learned by universities about the challenge of protecting free speech while also advancing social justice can help policymakers ensure that U.S. domestic and international policies affecting the internet will strengthen democracy and human rights. Reclaiming Free Speech for Democracy and Human Rights in a Digitally Networked World , Rebecca MacKinnon, founding director of New America’s Ranking Digital Rights and 2019-2020 fellow with the University of California National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement, offers a comparative analysis of free speech challenges in these online and offline spaces. The paper analyzes online and campus free speech issues, maps concerns and policy proposals raised by global civil society over the past fifteen years, and concludes with recommendations for U.S. policymakers.  the new U.S. administration must commit to working with global allies to ensure that domestic policies align with international human rights standards, and that policies foster a more diverse, decentralized, accessible, and equitable internet for all. This research paper is divided into three sections. The first section discusses the relevance of international human rights standards to U.S. internet platforms and universities. The second section identifies three common challenges to universities and internet platforms, with clear policy implications. The third section recommends approaches to internet policy that can better protect human rights and strengthen democracy. The paper concludes with proposals for how universities can contribute to the creation of a more robust digital information ecosystem that protects free speech along with other human rights, and advances social justice. 1) International human rights standards are an essential complement to the First Amendment.  While the First Amendment does not apply to how privately owned and operated digital platforms set and enforce rules governing their users’ speech, international human rights standards set forth a clear framework to which companies any other type of private organization can and should be held accountable. Scholars of international law and freedom of expression point out that Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights encompasses not only free speech, but also the right to access information and to formulate opinions without interference. Notably, this aspect of international human rights law is relevant in addressing the harms caused by disinformation campaigns aided by algorithms and targeted profiling. In protecting freedom of expression, private companies and organizations must also protect and respect other human rights, including privacy, non-discrimination, assembly, the right to political participation, and the basic right to security of person. . These common challenges must be addressed in order to protect free speech alongside other fundamental human rights including non-discrimination: . In an inequitable and unjust world, “neutral” platforms and institutions will perpetuate and even exacerbate inequities and power imbalances unless they understand and adjust for those inequities and imbalances. This fundamental civil rights concept is better understood by the leaders of universities than by those in charge of social media platforms, which have clear impact on public discourse and civic engagement. Challenge 2: Rules and enforcement are inadequate without strong leadership and cultural norms.  Rules governing speech, and their enforcement, can be ineffective and even counterproductive unless they are accompanied by values-based leadership. Institutional cultures should take into account the context and circumstances of unique situations, individuals, and communities. For rules to have legitimacy, communities that are governed by them must be actively engaged in building a shared culture of responsibility. Challenge 3: Communities need to be able to shape how and where they enable discourse and conduct learning.  Different types of discourse that serve different purposes require differently designed spaces—be they physical or digital. It is important for communities to be able to set their own rules of engagement, and shape their spaces for different types of discourse. Overdependence upon a small number of corporate-controlled platforms does not serve communities well. Online free speech not only will be better served by policies that foster competition and strengthen antitrust law; policies and resources must also support the development of nonprofit, open source, and community-driven digital public infrastructure. 3) A clear and consistent policy environment that supports civil rights objectives and is compatible with human rights standards is to ensure that the digital public sphere evolves in a way that genuinely protects free speech and advances social justice.  Analysis of twenty different consensus declarations, charters, and principles produced by international coalitions of civil society organizations reveals broad consensus with U.S.-based advocates of civil rights-compatible technology policy. These significant consensus documents include calls to: The transition to a new U.S. administration also offers an opportunity for constructive re-evaluation and revision of the Obama administration’s global internet freedom policy. While the United States and other major democracies worked together through much of the past decade to advance the common policy goal of a free and open global internet, they failed to make or implement clear commitments to protect other human rights on the internet, including privacy and non-discrimination. They also lacked the political will to integrate domestic and foreign policies into a coherent approach to internet policymaking grounded in universal human rights standards. The emphasis on a global free flow of information without sufficient attention to other human rights helped to maximize U.S. internet platforms’ global dominance. There was no credible interrogation of – let alone effort to check – the ways that U.S. commercial social media platforms have exacerbated power imbalances and inequities in many societies, with harmful implications for human rights. The next U.S. administration must commit to working with global allies not only to ensure that domestic policies align with international human rights standards, but also to foster a more diverse and decentralized information sphere. Different companies and nations hold asymmetric power over online speech and information flows. This asymmetry exacerbates global inequality and impedes internet users’ freedom of expression in many countries. Policies that protect online freedom of expression and privacy must also be reinforced by complementary policies that expand the number and types of spaces for online discourse, in order to include more platforms over which communities have control and agency. Universities have a critical role to play in incubating, informing, and supporting the development of digital public infrastructure and spaces for civic discourse and engagement that protect free speech and uphold values of social justice—on campus and beyond. https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/fellows-19-20/mackinnon-research/  
Free speech is dying in the Western world. While most people still enjoy considerable freedom of expression, this right, once a near-absolute, has become less defined and less dependable for those espousing controversial social, political or religious views. The decline of free speech has come not from any single blow but rather from thousands of paper cuts of well-intentioned exceptions designed to maintain social harmony. In the face of the violence that frequently results from anti-religious expression, some world leaders seem to be losing their patience with free speech. After a video called “Innocence of Muslims” appeared on YouTube and sparked   last month, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned that “when some people use this freedom of expression to provoke or humiliate some others’ values and beliefs, then this cannot be protected.” It appears that the one thing modern society can no longer tolerate is intolerance. As Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard put it in her recent speech before the United Nations, “Our tolerance must never extend to tolerating religious hatred.” A willingness to confine free speech in the name of social pluralism can be seen at various levels of authority and government. In February, for instance, Pennsylvania Judge Mark Martin heard a case in which a Muslim man was charged with attacking an atheist marching in a Halloween parade as a “zombie Muhammed.” Martin castigated not the defendant but the victim, Ernie Perce, lecturing him that “our forefathers intended to use the First Amendment so we can speak with our mind, not to piss off other people and cultures — which is what you did.” Of course, free speech is often precisely about pissing off other people — challenging social taboos or political values. This was evident in recent days when courts in Washington and New York ruled that transit authorities could not prevent or delay the posting of a controversial ad that says: “In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat jihad.”  simply because it could upset some Metro riders, the ruling prompted calls for new limits on such speech. And in New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority responded by unanimously passing a new regulation banning any message that it considers likely to “incite” others or cause some “other immediate breach of the peace.” Such efforts focus not on the right to speak but on the possible reaction to speech — a fundamental change in the treatment of free speech in the West. The much-misconstrued statement of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes that free speech does not give you the right to shout fire in a crowded theater is now being used to curtail speech that might provoke a violence-prone minority. Our entire society is being treated as a crowded theater, and talking about whole subjects is now akin to shouting “fire!” The new restrictions are forcing people to meet the demands of the lowest common denominator of accepted speech, usually using one of four rationales. This is the oldest threat to free speech, but it has experienced something of a comeback in the 21st century. After protests erupted throughout the Muslim world in 2005 over Danish cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad, Western countries publicly professed fealty to free speech, yet quietly cracked down on anti-religious expression. Religious critics in France, Britain, Italy and other countries have found themselves under criminal investigation as threats to public safety. In France, actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot has been fined several times for comments about how Muslims are undermining French culture. And just last month, a Greek atheist was arrested for insulting a famous monk by making his name sound like that of a pasta dish.  Some Western countries have classic blasphemy laws — such as Ireland, which in 2009 criminalized the “publication or utterance of blasphemous matter” deemed “grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion.” The Russian Duma recently proposed a law against “insulting religious beliefs.” Other countries allow the arrest of people who threaten strife by criticizing religions or religious leaders. In Britain, for instance, a 15-year-old girl was arrested two years ago Western governments seem to be sending the message that free speech rights will not protect you — as shown clearly last month by the images of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula,  , being carted away in California on suspicion of probation violations. Dutch politician Geert Wilders went through years of litigation before he was acquitted last year on charges of insulting Islam by voicing anti-Islamic views. In the Netherlandsand Italy, cartoonists and comedians have been charged with insulting religion through caricatures or jokes.  of a resolution in the U.N. Human Rights Council to create an international standard restricting some anti-religious speech (its full name: “Combating Intolerance, Negative Stereotyping and Stigmatization of, and Discrimination, Incitement to Violence and Violence Against, Persons Based on Religion or Belief”). Egypt’s U.N. ambassador heralded the resolution as exposing the “true nature” of free speech and recognizing that “freedom of expression has been sometimes misused” to insult religion. At a Washington conference last yearto implement the resolution, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton   that it would protect both “the right to practice one’s religion freely and the right to express one’s opinion without fear.” But it isn’t clear how speech can be protected if the yardstick is how people react to speech — particularly in countries where people riot over a single cartoon. Clinton suggested that free speech resulting in “sectarian clashes” or “the destruction or the defacement or the vandalization of religious sites” was not, as she put it, “fair game.” In the United States, hate speech is presumably protected under the First Amendment. However, hate-crime laws often redefine hateful expression as a criminal act. Thus, in 2003, the Supreme Court addressed the conviction of a Virginia Ku Klux Klan member who burned a cross on private land. The court allowed for criminal penalties so long as the government could show that the act was “intended to intimidate” others. It was a distinction without meaning, since the state can simply cite the intimidating history of that symbol. Other Western nations routinely bar forms of speech considered hateful. Britain prohibits any “abusive or insulting words” meant “to stir up racial hatred.” Canada outlaws “any writing, sign or visible representation” that “incites hatred against any identifiable group.” These laws ban speech based not only on its content but on the reaction of others. Speakers are often called to answer for their divisive or insulting speech before bodies like the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. This month, a Canadian court ruled that Marc Lemire, the webmaster of a far-right political site, could be punished for allowing third parties to leave insulting comments about homosexuals and blacks on the site. Echoing the logic behind blasphemy laws, Federal Court Justice Richard Mosley ruled that “the minimal harm caused . . . to freedom of expression is far outweighed by the benefit it provides to vulnerable groups and to the promotion of equality.” Perhaps the most rapidly expanding limitation on speech is found in anti-discrimination laws. Many Western countries have extended such laws to public statements deemed insulting or derogatory to any group, race or gender.  For example, in a closely watched case last year, a French court found fashion designer John Galliano  in a Paris bar, where he got into a cursing match with a couple using sexist and anti-Semitic terms. Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud read a list of the bad words Galliano had used, adding that she found (rather implausibly) he had said “dirty whore” at least 1,000 times. Though he faced up to six months in jail, he was fined. In Canada, comedian Guy Earle was charged with violating the human rights of a lesbian couple after he got into a trash-talking session with a group of women during an open-mike night at a nightclub. Lorna Pardysaid she suffered post-traumatic stress because of Earle’s profane language and derogatory terms for lesbians. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal ruled last year that since this was a matter of discrimination, free speech was not a defense, and awarded about $23,000 to the couple. Ironically, while some religious organizations are pushing blasphemy laws, religious individuals are increasingly targeted under anti-discrimination laws for their criticism of homosexuals and other groups. In 2008, a minister in Canada was not only forced to pay fines for uttering anti-gay sentiments but was also enjoined from expressing such views in the future. In the United States, where speech is given the most protection among Western countries, there has been a recent effort to carve out a potentially large category to which the First Amendment would not apply. While we have always prosecuted people who lie to achieve financial or other benefits, some argue that the government can outlaw any lie, regardless of whether the liar secured any economic gain. , signed by President George W. Bush in 2006, which made it a crime for people to lie about receiving military honors.  , but at least two liberal justices, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, proposed that such laws should have less of a burden to be upheld as constitutional. The House responded with new legislation that would criminalize lies told with the intent to obtain any undefined “tangible benefit.” The dangers are obvious. Government officials have long labeled whistleblowers, reporters and critics as “liars” who distort their actions or words. If the government can define what is a lie, it can define what is the truth. For example, in Februarythe French Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a law that made it a crime to deny the 1915 Armenian genocide by Turkey — a characterization that Turkey steadfastly rejects. Despite the ruling, various French leaders pledged to pass new measures punishing those who deny the Armenians’ historical claims.  The impact of government limits on speech has been magnified by even greater forms of private censorship. For example, most news organizations have stopped showing images of Muhammad, though they seem to have no misgivings about caricatures of other religious figures. The most extreme such example was supplied by Yale University Press, which in 2009 published a book about the Danish cartoons titled  The very right that laid the foundation for Western civilization is increasingly viewed as a nuisance, if not a threat. Whether speech is deemed imflammatory or hateful or discriminatory or simply false, society is denying speech rights in the name of tolerance, enforcing mutual respect through categorical censorship. As in a troubled marriage, the West seems to be falling out of love with free speech. Unable to divorce ourselves from this defining right, we take refuge instead in an awkward and forced silence.  is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University.

We take care of the uploads & business stuff so you can focus your energy on doing what you love – making great content. And the best part is you can do it as a collaborative team! I just love to wake up to those beautiful notification emails “You have received new earnings from your footage.” BlackBox is giving me a new way to think about life, happiness, doing my passion and making passive revenue. This disruption is making things  tough for video/film creators all over the world. , they can do the work they love, earn more, gig less, and have better lives. That’s the “we economy” and that means Creator Freedom. BlackBox is a global platform that helps creators tap into the global and growing demand for video content and make steady passive income.  Shoot high quality footage of the world around you, or "mine" your hard drives for Upload your footage to BlackBox, and after we review and accept the content, we'll get it to major stock agencies for you. This frees up more of your time for creating. For years. The better your portfolio in terms of quality, diversity and quantity, the more you make... and it's all on on autopilot. BlackBox is a creator community and platform that allows creators all over the world to connect, share the work, share the content ownership and share the passive income.. I received another email this morning titled: ‘You have a payout from BlackBox.’ What a great feeling! The best part for me is I can share the wealth with my collaborators, from talent to editors etc. It really is genius. Video/Film production is collaborative. It takes time, effort and commitment from multiple people with complementary skills to get world-class results. So we built a system that allows creators to  and ensure that every creator involved gets paid their fair share of any revenue that the content generates.  You can partner with an "editor/curator" from the BlackBox community, and assign them a percentage of revenue. Now you can focus more of your energy on what you love, and you both make money. Any person or entity can be part of BlackBox. Even studios, rental houses, and location owners can join in. Just make them "sharers" of the content, and get busy making great work you can all benefit from. No contracts, lawyers, or sketchy deferral deals necessary. Just work together making high quality content, and BlackBox will take care of the rest, securely and reliably. Now just imagine how this approach will work on projects like movies, series, music, games, etc.. We envision a world where every creator owns a piece of everything they work on. When we say revolutionary, we mean it.  BlackBox is what I’ve been looking for, for years. It’s given me the creative freedom to work with who I want, when I want and get paid for it fairly. I am so excited for the future with this company!  
 group popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The members of the group included a trio made up of club DJ Daniele Davoli, classically trained clarinet teacher Valerio Semplici, and keyboardist and electronic musician Mirko Limoni. The group created an image for Black Box using French fashion model Katrin Quinol on their album and single cover art as the supposed lead singer in all their music videos.  However, the band's success radically changed when it was revealed that Quinol was  Daniele Davoli, Valerio Semplici, and Mirko Limoni formed a production team called   The group's first single was a dance single called "Numero Uno", released in 1988. The song was often credited by their other alias,   In early 1989, they produced a single called "Vocalizado" for Italian singer Robby Magno. In mid-1989, the group released the maxi-single "Airport 89" under the name  ". The song became an international hit, peaking at number one in three countries, including the UK, where it became  ". The song became an international top-ten hit and gave the group their first number-one song on  ". Like its predecessors, the song also became an international hit and earned the group their second number one on the Dance chart.  and peaked at number one in the Australian chart.
In late 1990, the album's fourth single, " " was released as the album's fifth single. The song became another international top-ten hit for the group and earned them their third number-one single on the Dance chart. The album's final singles "Open Your Eyes" and "Hold On" performed moderately well on the charts. In the same year, Black Box released a re-issue of "Ride on Time" called "Bright on Time". Quinol, who did not contribute vocally or musically to the group's music, left Black Box in late 1991 after the band became the subject of a media backlash involving lip-syncing scandals and lawsuits.
 In 1993, Black Box added American singer Charvoni Woodson to the lineup. They released the single "Rockin' to the Music", which performed poorly on the charts. In 1995, Black Box released their second album,  , which failed to chart or rise to the same level of success as their previous record. The album spawned the singles "Not Anyone" and "A Positive Vibration", both of which fared well on the charts. In 1997, the album was re-issued with three additional singles: "I Got the Vibration", "Native New Yorker", and "Fall Into My Love".
 . In 1999, a maxi single of remixes for "Bright on Time" was exclusively released in France.
 Woodson continued touring and performing as the lead vocalist of the group periodically until 2015. That year, Celestine Walcott-Gordon began performing live as the new lead vocalist. In 2018, the group released the single "Everyone Will Follow", featuring vocals by Walcott-Gordon.
  "Ride on Time" sampled Holloway's song "Love Sensation", which was produced and written by Hartman. Neither Holloway nor Hartman were consulted for permission to sample the song, and Black Box failed to credit Holloway's vocals in the song. Additionally, Black Box had used Quinol to lip-sync Holloway's vocals in the music video for "Ride on Time", which led the public to believe Quinol was the actual singer. After a lengthy court case, it was ruled in favor of Holloway and Hartman. Both received an undisclosed   As a result, Black Box re-issued their single "Ride on Time", removing Holloway's vocals and featuring newly recorded vocals by English singer   and added Holloway's name as the featured vocalist on "Ride on Time" as well as giving Hartman songwriting credits. Black Box would later issue another new version of the song called "Bright on Time" in 1991.
  songs produced by Black Box. Unbeknownst to her, Black Box retained Wash's vocals on a total of six songs, including "Everybody Everybody", "Open Your Eyes", "Hold On", "I Don't Know Anybody Else", "Strike It Up", and "Fantasy" on the album  . Despite Wash's contributions to the songs, Black Box never credited her for her vocals and instead used Quinol to lip-sync Wash's vocals during music videos, televised performances, and concert performances. RCA settled the case out of court in December 1990, agreeing to pay Wash a "substantial" financial fee.  The company also signed her to an eight-album recording contract and financed her national tour.  Wash's lawsuit also resulted in federal legislation making vocal credit mandatory for all albums and music videos. "Lawsuits! Miming! An M-Person!

Safely store secrets in a VCS repo (i.e. Git, Mercurial, Subversion or Perforce). These commands make it easy for you to Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG) encrypt specific files in a repo so they are "encrypted at rest" in your repository. However, the scripts make it easy to decrypt them when you need to view or edit them, and decrypt them for use in production. Originally written for Puppet, BlackBox now works with any Git or Mercurial repository. Suppose you have a VCS repository (i.e. a Git or Mercurial repo) and certain files contain secrets such as passwords or SSL private keys. Often people just store such files "and hope that nobody finds them in the repo". That's not safe. With BlackBox, those files are stored encrypted using GPG. Access to the VCS repo without also having the right GPG keys makes it worthless to have the files. As long as you keep your GPG keys safe, you don't have to worry about storing your VCS repo on an untrusted server. Heck, even if you trust your server, now you don't have to trust the people that do backups of that server, or the people that handle the backup tapes! Rather than one GPG passphrase for all the files, each person with access has their own GPG keys in the system. Any file can be decrypted by anyone with their GPG key. This way, if one person leaves the company, you don't have to communicate a new password to everyone with access. Simply disable the one key that should no longer have access. The process for doing this is as easy as running 2 commands (1 to disable their key, 1 to re-encrypt all files.) Automated processes often need access to all the decrypted files. This is easy too. For example, suppose Git is being used for Puppet files. The master needs access to the decrypted version of all the files. Simply set up a GPG key for the Puppet master (or the role account that pushes new files to the Puppet master) and have that user run  ;
this will decrypt the file and open with whatever is specified by
your $EDITOR environment variable.  
When you close the editor the
file will automatically be encrypted again and the temporary plaintext
file will be shredded.  OBVIOUSLY we don't want secret things like SSL private keys and passwords to be leaked. NOT SO OBVIOUSLY when we store "secrets" in a VCS repo like Git or Mercurial, suddenly we are less able to share our code with other people. Communication between subteams of an organization is hurt. You can't collaborate as well. Either you find yourself emailing individual files around (yuck!), making a special repo with just the files needed by your collaborators (yuck!!), or just deciding that collaboration isn't worth all that effort (yuck!!!). The ability to be open and transparent about our code, with the exception of a few specific files, is key to the kind of collaboration that DevOps and modern IT practitioners need to do. BlackBox automatically determines which VCS you are using and does the right thing. It has a plug-in architecture to make it easy to extend to work with other systems. It has been tested to work with many operating systems. To add or fix support for a new operating system, look for the case statements in   will have
LF line endings. Windows users should be careful to configure Git or other systems
to not convert or "fix" those files. GPG has many different ways to encrypt a file. BlackBox uses the mode that lets you specify a list of keys that can decrypt the message. If you have 5 people ("admins") that should be able to access the secrets, each creates a GPG key and adds their public key to the keychain. The GPG command used to encrypt the file lists all 5 key names, and therefore any 1 key can decrypt the file. To remove someone's access, remove that admin's key name (i.e. email address) from the list of admins and re-encrypt all the files. They can still read the .gpg file (assuming they have access to the repository) but they can't decrypt it any more.  Yes, they can decrypt old versions of the file. This is why when an admin leaves the team, you should change all your passwords, SSL certs, and so on. You should have been doing that before BlackBox, right?  In other words, why mess with all this GPG key stuff and instead why don't we just encrypt all the files with a single passphrase. Yes, GPG supports that, but then we are managing a shared password, which is fraught with problems. If someone "leaves the team" we would have to communicate to everyone a new password. Now we just have to remove their key. This scales better.  GPG requires a passphrase on a private key. However, it permits the creation of subkeys that have no passphrase. For automated processes, create a subkey that is only stored on the machine that needs to decrypt the files. For example, at Stack Exchange, when our Continuous Integration (CI) system pushes a code change to our Puppet masters, they run   to decrypt all the files. The user that runs this code has a subkey that doesn't require a passphrase. Since we have many masters, each has its own key. And, yes, this means our Puppet Masters have to be very secure. However, they were already secure because, like, dude... if you can break into someone's puppet master you own their network. Ansible Vault provides functionality for encrypting both entire files and strings stored within files; however,
keeping track of the password(s) required for decryption is not handled by this module. Entire files, such as SSL certs and private keys, are treated just like regular files. You decrypt them any time you push a new release to the puppet master. file { '/etc/my_little_secret.key':
    ensure  => 'file',
    owner   => 'root',
    group   => 'puppet',
    mode    => '0760',
    source  => "puppet:///modules/${module_name}/secret_file.key",
}
 Small strings, such as passwords and API keys, are stored in a hiera yaml file, which you encrypt with  $the_password = hiera('module::test_password', 'fail')

file {'/tmp/debug-blackbox.txt':
    content => $the_password,

  is a file that lists which users are able to decrypt files. (More pedantically, it is a list of the GnuPG key names that the file is encrypted for.) To join the list of people that can edit the file requires three steps; You create a GPG key and add it to the key ring. Then, someone that already has access adds you to the system. Lastly, you should test your access. Step 1: YOU create a GPG key pair on a secure machine and add to public keychain. WARNING: New versions of GPG generate keys which are not understood by
old versions of GPG.  If you generate a key with a new version of GPG,
this will cause problems for users of older versions of GPG.
Therefore it is recommended that you either assure that everyone using
Blackbox have the exact same version of GPG, or generate GPG keys
using a version of GPG as old as the oldest version of GPG used by
everyone using Blackbox. Pick defaults for encryption settings, 0 expiration. Pick a VERY GOOD passphrase. Store a backup of the private key someplace secure. For example, keep the backup copy on a USB drive that is locked in safe.  Or, at least put it on a secure machine with little or no internet access, full-disk-encryption, etc. Your employer probably has rules about how to store such things. FYI: If generating the key is slow, this is usually because the system
isn't generating enough entropy.  Tip: Open another window on that
machine and run this command:  ...where "KEYNAME" is the email address listed in the gpg key you created previously. For example: When the command completes successfully, instructions on how to commit these changes will be output. Run the command as given to commit the changes. It will look like this: git commit -m'NEW ADMIN: tal@example.com' .blackbox/pubring.gpg .blackbox/trustdb.gpg .blackbox/blackbox-admins.txt
 NOTE: Creating a Role Account? If you are adding the pubring.gpg of a role account, you can specify the directory where the pubring.gpg file can be found as a 2nd parameter:  Ask someone that already has access to re-encrypt the data files. This gives you access. They simply decrypt and re-encrypt the data without making any changes. git pull    # Or whatever is required for your system
gpg --homedir=.blackbox --list-keys
 For example, examine the key name (email address) to make sure it conforms to corporate standards. Make sure you can decrypt a file. (Suggestion: Keep a dummy file in VCS just for new people to practice on.) When the command completes, you will be given a reminder to check in the change and push it. Note that their keys will still be in the key ring, but they will go unused. If you'd like to clean up the keyring, use the normal GPG commands and check in the file. gpg --homedir=.blackbox --list-keys
gpg --homedir=.blackbox --delete-key olduser@example.com
git commit -m'Cleaned olduser@example.com from keyring'  .blackbox/*
 Remember that this person did have access to all the secrets at one time. They could have made a copy. Therefore, to be completely secure, you should change all passwords, generate new SSL keys, and so on just like when anyone that had privileged access leaves an organization. There is no technical reason to convert old repos except that it is less
confusing to users. Once that is done, is a good idea to test the system by making sure a file can be added to the system (see "How to enroll a new file into the system?"), and a different user can decrypt the file. rm -f foo.txt.gpg foo.txt
echo This is a test. >foo.txt
blackbox_register_new_file foo.txt
 blackbox_edit_start foo.txt.gpg
cat foo.txt
echo This is the new file contents. >foo.txt
  and make sure another user can check out, view, and change the contents of the file. That is left as an exercise for the reader. If you are feel like taking a risk, don't commit  An automated user (a "role account") is one that that must be able to decrypt without a passphrase. In general you'll want to do this for the user that pulls the files from the repo to the master. This may be automated with Jenkins CI or other CI system. GPG keys have to have a passphrase. However, passphrases are optional on subkeys. Therefore, we will create a key with a passphrase then create a subkey without a passphrase. Since the subkey is very powerful, it should be created on a very secure machine. There's another catch. The role account probably can't check files into Git/Mercurial. It probably only has read-only access to the repo. That's a good security policy. This means that the role account can't be used to upload the subkey public bits into the repo. Therefore, we will create the key/subkey on a secure machine as yourself. From there we can commit the public portions into the repo. Also from this account we will export the parts that the role account needs, copy them to where the role account can access them, and import them as the role account.

You can run these tests to verify that the changes you made didn't break anything. You can also use these tests to verify that the system works with a new operating system. The best way to change BlackBox is via Test Driven Development. First add a test to  . This test should fail, and demonstrate the need for the change you are about to make. Then fix the bug or add the feature you want. When you are done,   should pass all tests. The PR you submit should include your code as well as the new test. This way the confidence tests accumulate as the system grows as we know future changes don't break old features. Note: The tests currently assume "git" and have been tested only on CentOS, Mac OS X, and Cygwin. Patches welcome! Here are other open source packages that do something similar to BlackBox. If you like them better than BlackBox, please use them. git-crypt has the best git integration. Once set up it is nearly transparent to the users. However it only works with git.  
Acid rain, or acid deposition, is a broad term that includes any form of precipitation with acidic components, such as sulfuric or nitric acid that fall to the ground from the atmosphere in wet or dry forms.  This can include rain, snow, fog, hail or even dust that is acidic.   ) are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents. The SO  react with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids.  These then mix with water and other materials before falling to the ground.  that cause acid rain is from natural sources such as volcanoes, most of it comes from the burning of fossil fuels.  The major sources of SO  over long distances and across borders making acid rain a problem for everyone and not just those who live close to these sources.  .  The sulfuric and nitric acids formed in the atmosphere fall to the ground mixed with rain, snow, fog, or hail.   Acidic particles and gases can also deposit from the atmosphere in the absence of moisture as  .  The acidic particles and gases may deposit to surfaces (water bodies, vegetation, buildings) quickly or may react during atmospheric transport to form larger particles that can be harmful to human health. When the accumulated acids are washed off a surface by the next rain, this acidic water flows over and through the ground, and can harm plants and wildlife, such as insects and fish. The amount of acidity in the atmosphere that deposits to earth through dry deposition depends on the amount of rainfall an area receives.  For example, in desert areas the ratio of dry to wet deposition is higher than an area that receives several inches of rain each year. Acidity and alkalinity are measured using a pH scale for which 7.0 is neutral. The lower a substance's pH (less than 7), the more acidic it is; the higher a substance's pH (greater than 7), the more alkaline it is. Normal rain has a pH of about 5.6; it is slightly acidic because carbon dioxide (CO ) dissolves into it forming weak carbonic acid.  Acid rain usually has a pH between 4.2 and 4.4. Policymakers, research scientists, ecologists, and modelers rely on the National Atmospheric Deposition Program’s (NADP) National Trends Network (NTN) for measurements of wet deposition. The NADP/NTN collects acid rain at more than 250 monitoring sites throughout the US, Canada, Alaska, Hawaii and the US Virgin Islands. Unlike wet deposition, dry deposition is difficult and expensive to measure. Dry deposition estimates for nitrogen and sulfur pollutants are provided by the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET). Air concentrations are measured by CASTNET at more than 90 locations. When acid deposition is washed into lakes and streams, it can cause some to turn acidic. The Long-Term Monitoring (LTM) Network measures and monitors surface water chemistry at over 280 sites to provide valuable information on aquatic ecosystem health and how water bodies respond to changes in acid-causing emissions and acid deposition.

Acid rain is caused by emissions of   to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by   Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters, and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel,  "Acid rain" is a popular term referring to the deposition of a mixture from wet (rain, snow, sleet, fog,  cloudwater, and dew) and dry (acidifying particles and gases) acidic components.   is removed, has a neutral pH of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a   greater than 7 are alkaline. "Clean" or unpolluted rain has an acidic pH, but usually no lower than 5.7, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form  Unpolluted rain can also contain other chemicals which affect its pH (acidity level). A common example is  The corrosive effect of polluted, acidic city air on limestone and marble was noted in the 17th century by  , emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere have increased.  was the first to show the relationship between acid rain and atmospheric pollution in  In the late 1960s, scientists began widely observing and studying the phenomenon.  Canadian Harold Harvey was among the first to research a "dead" lake. At first, the main focus in research lay on local effects of acid rain.   was the first to acknowledge long-distance transportation of pollutants crossing borders from the United Kingdom to Norway. Occasional pH readings in rain and fog water of well below 2.4 have been reported in industrialized areas. The problem of acid rain has not only increased with population and industrial growth, but has become more widespread. The use of tall smokestacks to reduce local   has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation.  Often deposition occurs a considerable distance downwind of the emissions, with mountainous regions tending to receive the greatest deposition (because of their higher rainfall). An example of this effect is the low pH of rain which falls in  ", with waterproof covers every winter, in order to protect them from corrosion caused by acid rain and acid snow The earliest report about acid rain in the United States was from the chemical evidence from   of New Hampshire was acidic. The pH of the sample was measured to be 4.03 at Hubbard Brook.  The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study followed up with a series of research that analyzed the environmental effects of acid rain. Acid rain that mixed with stream water at Hubbard Brook was neutralized by the alumina from soils.  The result of this research indicates the chemical reaction between acid rain and aluminum leads to an increasing rate of soil weathering. Experimental research was done to examine the effects of increased acidity in stream on ecological species. In 1980, a group of scientists modified the acidity of Norris Brook, New Hampshire, and observed the change in species' behaviors. There was a decrease in species diversity, an increase in community dominants, and a decrease in the   This Act established an 18-year assessment and research program under the direction of the National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP). NAPAP looked at the entire problem from a scientific perspective. It enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was, and to determine long-term trends, and established a network for dry deposition. Using a statistically based sampling design, NAPAP quantified the effects of acid rain on a regional basis by targeting research and surveys to identify and quantify the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems.  NAPAP also assessed the effects of acid rain on historical buildings, monuments, and building materials. It also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs.
 From the start, policy advocates from all sides attempted to influence NAPAP activities to support their particular policy advocacy efforts, or to disparage those of their opponents.   For the US Government's scientific enterprise, a significant impact of NAPAP were lessons learned in the assessment process and in environmental research management to a relatively large group of scientists, program managers, and the public.  President Ronald Reagan did not place a huge attention on the issues of acid rain  until his personal visit to Canada and confirmed that Canadian border suffered from the drifting pollution from smokestacks in Midwest of US. Reagan honored the agreement to   to serve on a panel to draft a report on acid rain. In 1983, the panel of scientists came up with a draft report, which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought.  The panelists revealed rejections against Singer's positions and submitted the report to Nierenberg in April. In May 1983, the House of Representatives voted against legislation that aimed to control sulfur emissions. There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report. Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the House's vote was due to the fact that the report was not ready to be published.  It reported that 5% of New England Lakes were acidic, with sulfates being the most common problem. They noted that 2% of the lakes could no longer support  , and 6% of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow. Subsequent   have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems, nitrogen saturation, decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil, episodic acidification, regional haze, and damage to historical monuments.
  It was implemented in two phases. Phase I began in 1995, and limited sulfur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulfur dioxide. One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. Phase II began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.

In 2007 the EPA estimated that by 2010, the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers would be $1 billion to $2 billion a year, only one fourth of what was originally predicted.  Forbes says: "In 2010, by which time the cap and trade system had been augmented by the George W. Bush administration's Clean Air Interstate Rule, SO2 emissions had fallen to 5.1 million tons."  entitled 'Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective' a first use of the term 'citizen science' by R.

The first recorded example of the use of the term is from 1989, describing how 225 volunteers across the US collected rain samples to assist the Audubon Society in an acid-rain awareness raising campaign. The volunteers collected samples, checked for acidity, and reported back to the organization. The information was then used to demonstrate the full extent of the phenomenon."  to whole lakes in controlled ecosystem experiments to simulate the effects of acid rain. Because its remote conditions allowed for whole-ecosystem experiments, research at the ELA showed that the effect of acid rain on fish populations started at concentrations much lower than those observed in laboratory experiments. , fish populations crashed earlier than when acid rain had direct toxic effects to the fish because the acidity led to crashes in   As experimental acid inputs were reduced, fish populations and lake ecosystems recovered at least partially, although   This research showed both that acidification was linked to declining fish populations and that the effects could be reversed if sulfuric acid emissions decreased, and influenced policy in Canada and the United States.  The provinces agreed to limit their combined sulfur dioxide emissions to 2.3 million tonnes by 1994. The Canada-US Air Quality Agreement was signed in 1991.  Ministers of Energy and Environment signed The Canada-Wide Acid Rain Strategy for Post-2000, which was designed to protect lakes that are more sensitive than those protected by earlier policies. The most important gas which leads to acidification is sulfur dioxide. Emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form   are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulfur compounds. 70 Tg(S) per year in the form of SO  create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog, with acidity as high as a pH of 2, clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements. Acid-producing gasses are also created by   for plant life, and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as   are naturally very acidic due to the shedding of needles, and the results of this phenomenon should not be confused with acid rain.
 The principal cause of acid rain is sulfur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as  . Electrical power generation using coal is among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollution responsible for acidic rain. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. In the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke, but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. However, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage.
 Combustion of fuels produces sulfur dioxide and nitric oxides. They are converted into sulfuric acid and nitric acid. This shows the process of the air pollution being released into the atmosphere and the areas that will be affected.  is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone. This is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets.
 ) to S(VI), leading to the formation of sulfuric acid. The most important oxidation reactions are with  Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition. Acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation. This can be responsible for as much as 20 to 60% of total acid deposition.  This occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground, plants or other surfaces. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms as well as causing damage to buildings and having impacts on human health.
 Not all fish, shellfish, or the insects that they eat can tolerate the same amount of acid; for example, frogs can tolerate water that is more acidic (i.e., has a lower pH) than trout. Both the lower pH and higher aluminium concentrations in surface water that occur as a result of acid rain can cause damage to fish and other aquatic animals. At pH lower than 5 most fish eggs will not hatch and lower pH can kill adult fish. As lakes and rivers become more acidic biodiversity is reduced. Acid rain has eliminated insect life and some fish species, including the   in some lakes, streams, and creeks in geographically sensitive areas, such as the Adirondack Mountains of the United States.  However, the extent to which acid rain contributes directly or indirectly via runoff from the catchment to lake and river acidity (i.e., depending on characteristics of the surrounding watershed) is variable. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website states: "Of the lakes and streams surveyed, acid rain caused acidity in 75% of the acidic lakes and about 50% of the acidic streams".  Lakes hosted by silicate basement rocks are more acidic than lakes within limestone or other basement rocks with a carbonate composition (i.e. marble) due to buffering effects by carbonate minerals, even with the same amount of acid rain.  and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pH and are killed.  (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize  Soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are leached by acid rain, thereby affecting sensitive species, such as   on plants could be minor or in most cases major. Most minor cases which do not result in fatality of plant life can be attributed to the plants being less susceptible to acidic conditions and/or the acid rain being less potent. However, even in minor cases, the plant will eventually die due to the acidic water lowering the plant's natural pH.  Acidic water enters the plant and causes important plant minerals to dissolve and get carried away; which ultimately causes the plant to die of lack of minerals for nutrition. In major cases, which are more extreme, the same process of damage occurs as in minor cases, which is removal of essential minerals, but at a much quicker rate.  Likewise, acid rain that falls on soil and on plant leaves causes drying of the waxy leaf cuticle, which ultimately causes rapid water loss from the plant to the outside atmosphere and eventually results in death of the plant.  To see if a plant is being affected by soil acidification, one can closely observe the plant leaves. If the leaves are green and look healthy, the   is normal and acceptable for plant life. But if the plant leaves have yellowing between the veins on their leaves, that means the plant is suffering from acidification and is unhealthy.  Moreover, a plant suffering from soil acidification cannot photosynthesize; the acid-water-induced process of drying out of the plant can destroy chloroplast organelles.  Without being able to photosynthesize, a plant cannot create nutrients for its own survival or oxygen for the survival of aerobic organisms, which affects most species on Earth and ultimately ends the purpose of the plant's existence. Adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain, like the acid's effects on soil (see above) or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain. High altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain. Other plants can also be damaged by acid rain, but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. In cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the pH stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce, these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death. Acid rain has a much less harmful effect on oceans on a global scale, but it creates an amplified impact in the shallower waters of coastal waters.  that they need to survive. These coastal species link together as part of the ocean's food chain, and without them being a source for other marine life to feed off of, more marine life will die.  Coral's limestone skeleton is particularly sensitive to pH decreases, because the  , a core component of the limestone skeleton, dissolves in acidic (low pH) solutions.
 In addition to acidification, excess nitrogen inputs from the atmosphere promote increased growth of  Acid rain does not directly affect human health. The acid in the rainwater is too dilute to have direct adverse effects. The particulates responsible for acid rain (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) do have an adverse effect. Increased amounts of fine particulate matter in the air contribute to heart and lung problems, including  Acid rain can damage buildings, historic monuments, and statues, especially those made of rocks, such as  , that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate. Acids in the rain react with the calcium compounds in the stones to create gypsum, which then flakes off.
 The effects of this are commonly seen on old gravestones, where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely illegible. Acid rain also increases the  Places significantly impacted by acid rain around the globe include most of eastern Europe from Poland northward into Scandinavia,  (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% or more of the SO  in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral   that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.

The effects of acid rain can last for generations, as the effects of pH level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources, killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to  International treaties on the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed for example, the  In this regulatory scheme, every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits.

The USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) contains extensive water-quality data for thousands of sites nationwide. Depending on where you live, maybe you've heard of acid rain. Now, acid rain is not pure acid falling from the sky, but rather it is rainfall or atmospheric moisture that has been mixed with elements and gases that have caused the moisture to become more acidic than normal. Pure water has a pH of 7, and, generally, rainfall is somewhat on the acidic side (a bit less than 6). But, acid rain can have a pH of about 5.0-5.5, and can even be in the 4 range in the northeastern United States, where there are a lot of industries and cars.  scald=74458:float_right {"link":"%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2Fforest-affected-acid-rain"}  Dead or dying trees are a common sight in areas effected by acid rain like these woods in the   Mountains in the Czech Republic. Acid rain leaches aluminum from the soil.  That aluminum may be harmful to plants as well as animals. Acid rain also removes minerals and nutrients from the soil that trees need to grow.   can be caused by natural (volcanoes) and man-made activities, such as from cars and in the generation of electricity. The precursors, or chemical forerunners, of acid rain formation result from both natural sources, such as volcanoes and decaying vegetation, and man-made sources, primarily emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO ) resulting from fossil fuel combustion. The burning of fossil fuels (coal and oil) by power-production companies and industries releases sulfur into the air that combines with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide (SO ). Exhausts from cars cause the formation of nitrogen oxides in the air. From these gases, airborne sulfuric acid (H  in the air. Although acid-rain gases may originate in urban areas, they are often carried for hundreds of miles in the   by winds into rural areas. That is why forests and lakes in the countryside can be harmed by acid rain that originates in cities. The environment can generally adapt to a certain amount of acid rain. Often soil is slightly basic (due to naturally occurring limestone, which has a   of greater than 7). Because bases counteract acids, these soils tend to balance out some of the acid rain's acidity. But in areas, such as some of the Rocky Mountains and parts of the northwestern and southeastern United States, where limestone does not naturally occur in the soil, acid rain can harm the environment. Some fish and animals, such as frogs, have a hard time adapting to and reproducing in an acidic environment. Many plants, such as evergreen trees, are damaged by acid rain and acid fog. I've seen some of the acid-rain damage to the evergreen forests in the Black Forest of Germany. Much of the Black Forest was indeed black because so much of the green pine needles had been destroyed, leaving only the black trunks and limbs! You also might notice how acid rain has eaten away the stone in some cities' buildings and stone artwork. Acidity in rain is measured by collecting samples of rain and measuring its pH. To find the distribution of rain acidity, weather conditions are monitored and rain samples are collected at sites all over the country. The areas of greatest acidity (lowest pH values) are located in the Northeastern United States. This pattern of high acidity is caused by the large number of cities, the dense population, and the concentration of power and industrial plants in the Northeast. In addition, the prevailing wind direction brings storms and pollution to the Northeast from the Midwest, and dust from the soil and rocks in the Northeastern United States is less likely to neutralize acidity in the rain. When you hear or read in the media about the effects of acid rain, you are usually told about the lakes, fish, and trees in New England and Canada. However, we are becoming aware of an additional concern: many of our historic buildings and monuments are located in the areas of highest acidity. In Europe, where buildings are much older and pollution levels have been ten times greater than in the United States, there is a growing awareness that pollution and acid rain are accelerating the deterioration of buildings and monuments. Stone weathers (deteriorates) as part of the normal geologic cycle through natural chemical, physical, and biological processes when it is exposed to the environment. This weathering process, over hundreds of millions of years, turned the Appalachian Mountains from towering peaks as high as the Rockies to the rounded knobs we see today. Our concern is that air pollution, particularly in urban areas, may be accelerating the normal, natural rate of stone deterioration, so that we may prematurely lose buildings and sculptures of historic or cultural value.  scald=74462:float_right {"link":"%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2Fsandstone-sculpture-weathered-air-and-acid-rain"}  This religious medieval sculpture, made of sandstone, has been degraded by the acidification of air and rains. The sculpture is located in Dresden, at the corner of  Many buildings and monuments are made of stone, and many buildings use stone for decorative trim. Granite is now the most widely used stone for buildings, monuments, and bridges. Limestone is the second most used building stone. It was widely used before Portland cement became available in the early 19th century because of its uniform color and texture and because it could be easily carved. Sandstone from local sources was commonly used in the Northeastern United States, especially before 1900. Nationwide, marble is used much less often than the other stone types, but it has been used for many buildings and monuments of historical significance. Because of their composition, some stones are more likely to be damaged by acidic deposition than others. Granite is primarily composed of silicate minerals, like feldspar and quartz, which are resistant to acid attack. Sandstone is also primarily composed of silica and is thus resistant. A few sandstones are less resistant because they contain a carbonate cement that dissolves readily in weak acid. Limestone and marble are primarily composed of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate), which dissolves readily in weak acid; in fact, this characteristic is often used to identify the mineral calcite. Acid precipitation affects stone primarily in two ways: dissolution and alteration. When sulfurous, sulfuric, and nitric acids in polluted air react with the calcite in marble and limestone, the calcite dissolves. In exposed areas of buildings and statues, we see roughened surfaces, removal of material, and loss of carved details. Stone surface material may be lost all over or only in spots that are more reactive. You might expect that sheltered areas of stone buildings and monuments would not be affected by acid precipitation. However, sheltered areas on limestone and marble buildings and monuments show blackened crusts that have spalled (peeled) off in some places, revealing crumbling stone beneath. This black crust is primarily composed of gypsum, a mineral that forms from the reaction between calcite, water, and sulfuric acid. Gypsum is  ; although it can form anywhere on carbonate stone surfaces that are exposed to sulfur dioxide gas (SO ), it is usually washed away. It remains only on protected surfaces that are not directly washed by the rain. Gypsum is white, but the crystals form networks that trap particles of dirt and pollutants, so the crust looks black. Eventually the black crusts blister and spall off, revealing crumbling stone.

Acid rain comes in many forms: rain, snow, sleet, hail, and fog (wet deposition), and as acid particles, aerosols, and gases (dry deposition). Acid deposition forms when sulfur dioxide (SO ) combine with moisture in the atmosphere to produce sulfuric acid and nitric acid. By the 1960s, it became clear to scientists that acid deposition was devastating natural resources across New York. The Catskill and Adirondack Mountains were particularly hard hit. Soils were becoming too acidic to maintain healthy forests with noticeable tree die-offs at higher elevations. Many lakes, mountain streams, and some rivers were unable to support healthy populations of fish.  - Freshwater macroinvertebrates, plants, and fish populations are damaged when acidic water disrupts their reproductive cycle. Aluminum leaches from the soil into the water, altering the chemistry and clogging the fish's gills. As water bodies become acidified, one species after another disappears. In addition to sensitive lakes, the Adirondack region includes thousands of miles of streams and rivers that are also sensitive to acidic deposition.  - Acid rain lowers the biological productivity of lakes and reduces the amount of forage fish available to loons. Toxicity from mercury pollution of water bodies can lead to decreased reproductive success of loons as well.  - Sulfur and nitrogen deposition have caused adverse impacts on highly-sensitive forest ecosystems, especially the high-elevation, spruce-fir forests in the eastern United States. Forests are damaged because acid precipitation drains nutrients from the soil. Excess nitrogen in the air also may adversely affect tree growth. Evidence of decreased growth and dieback has been found in the Adirondacks.  - The same pollutants that cause acid rain can degrade air quality and significantly reduce visibility, even in remote areas like the Adirondack Mountains.  - For buildings, bridges and cultural resources, acid deposition can cause damage. The sulfuric acid can have a corrosive effect on limestone and marble buildings and sculptures. Dry deposition can even be more damaging to stone than wet deposition for these structures.  - Walking in acid rain is no more dangerous to people than walking in non-acid rain. However, the pollutants that cause acid rain can be harmful to people. SO  can react in the atmosphere to form fine sulfate and nitrate particles. These particles can enter the lungs and cause lung disease, heart attacks, and difficulties for people with asthma. Acidified water can also cause metals to be leached from the soil into streams, lakes and reservoirs or old lead and copper pipes into home water supplies, causing serious illness. New York's first acid deposition program was established in 1985 in response to the State Acid Deposition Control Act (SADCA). This program was designed to measure acid deposition to assess the effectiveness of sulfur control policies and other strategies aimed at reducing the effects of acid rain. The program has documented environmental improvements resulting from NO  control strategies. For example, the deposition of sulfate statewide has decreased by more than 75% since the monitoring program began. And these concentrations of acidic pollutants continue to decline. The SADCA established an environmental threshold value of 20 kg/ha/yr for wet sulfate deposition. Currently all monitoring sites in New York are well below that threshold. At the end of 2012, the Department discontinued this program and transitioned six monitoring locations to the   (NADP) (leaves DEC website). The transition to the NADP program has provided data for use in regulation development. The NADP has also allowed for the comparison of data from New York with other acid sensitive regions across the country. NADP sites within New York and in neighboring states can better understand acid deposition across the northeastern US. Data and reports from this program from across the United States can found on the NADP webpage (see "Links Leaving DEC's Website"). Over the years, many programs and policies, have reduced emissions of pollutants that acidified clouds, fog, snow, sleet, and rain. One such program is the   (PDF) Program (link leaves DEC). The ALTM has been documenting changes in the chemistry of lakes, streams, and clouds in the Adirondack Mountains since the 1980s. More than 20 chemical parameters are measured in each ALTM water sample. These include sulfate (SO ), acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), pH, and toxic inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al), all are important indicators of lake ecosystem health. Research has shown that fish and other aquatic life are less resilient when exposed to certain chemical conditions. An example of some of these conditions are an ANC below 20 microequivalents per liter (µeq/L), pH below 6, and inorganic monomeric Al above 2 micromoles per liter (µmol/L). These conditions are most likely to occur during the spring snowmelt, generally March through April. Acid-forming air pollution has declined since the 1980s. As a result, Adirondack lakes and streams are beginning to recover. For example, the acidity level in Brooktrout Lake, thought to be fishless by the mid-1980s, has decreased about 90% since the Adirondack Lakes Survey Corporation began monitoring this lake in 1992. Brooktrout Lake is now able to support self-sustaining brook trout populations. The DEC and its ALTM partners will continue this important program to support key environmental policy efforts even as new stressors, such as climate change, emerge. More information about this can be found in the   data in the Adirondacks as part of the monitoring network created for the NYS Acid Deposition Control Act. Over 30 years data have shown consistent declines in SO  connected with reductions in emissions both within and upwind of New York State. One recent result of this decrease is that the continuous monitoring method is now inadequate in rural areas. Continuous SO  instruments were designed to produce data that can be compared to the higher levels relevant for the NAAQS.A large poster containing our data review over the period 2008-2017 is available below.

is the English plural. Dictionaries list both, and neither is right or wrong. Also, like many names of plants, the uninflected  can be attributed to the influence of Latin on biological nomenclature. These Latin plurals are not considered out of place in botany and other scientific fields, and some make their way into broader usage, but there’s no good reason that the ordinary English speaker should have to abide by the rules of Latin grammar.  is just as good), but this is one of the few exceptions. Most English speakers don’t say  has the edge, both forms are common in current news publications and blogs from throughout the English-speaking world—for example: For days, he trekked through desert plains dotted with cacti as vultures circled above his head. [ Ringed by cacti and red rock buttes and canyons, the town looks like it once was the set of every shoot ’em up cowboy movie. [ But near the visitor center, which was dug into the earth, irrigated areas coaxed succulent blooms from cactuses. [ One room has been converted into a type of conservatory, with tiny monkeys swinging from plants, cacti growing out of an old ball-and-claw couch and succulents everywhere. [ All cacti are succulents, but many other plant families include succulent species. [ Actually I had several science teachers use apparati, and I’ve always used virii (much to the annoyance of many around me), & cacti myself. Actually most people I know personally who deal with cacti get offended when anyone says cactuses, and around here there’s a lot of people with at least one cactus in their garden. The popularity of “cactuses” is by no means new, though, and actually it used to be much more common relative to “cacti” than it is now, as you can see in this ngram:  Yeah, that’s pretty much how language works…the popularity of words is important. “Modern” English has always been permissive that way…we get most of our words from other places, as most growing languages do (in order to grow)…etymology, for example, is a Latin (well, Greek originally) word, as are all of the word plurals you mentioned, which was mentioned in the article. As this was explained to me, “cacti” refers to many of the same type of plant. And “cactuses” refers to several different types. but i’m not sure what to use. some of my teachers say to write ‘cacti’. i’m Australian, so what do they say? Really?! And most college graduates don’t belong to the alumni society of their college or university. They belong to the alumnuses society. Being uneducated is not exactly a sound basis for deciding one is correct. “Most English speakers don’t say ani instead of anuses, apparati instead of apparatuses, campi instead of campuses, octopi instead of octopuses, stati instead of statuses, or viri instead viruses, and there’s no reason cactus should be any different. It’s a matter of preference, though, and cacti is not wrong.” As much as people love to “correct” on the internet, language is not math. There are arbitrary rules we may place on it, but the standard is only as consistent as what people use and mutually understand at any given time (hence the existence of colloquialisms, dialects and neologisms). Hence the practice of law… Interpretation. Good point. I have always said cacti myself, although recently it came to my attention that both are acceptable. I do enjoy what a poster said about about how the form changes based on specificity of quantity and kind.  The article says the cactus is Latin but actually it is Greek. The -us to -i is for Latin words, not for Greek.

Putting a sand block up to one of the stems, right under it, and then cutting the main cactus body, will make the branch a new cactus.  Cactus plants cannot be planted and will only grow on a target Sand Block under the following conditions: Cacti that are spawned after world generation will first always consist of a single stub and slowly extend over time.

Soak the soil until water runs through the pot’s drainage holes; wait a few minutes; and then discard any excess water that has accumulated in the drip pan beneath the pot. A water-soluble fertilizer recommended for flowering houseplants can be applied during its active growth, but be sure to follow the directions on the fertilizer container regarding the amount and frequency of application. The Christmas cactus prefers humid conditions, and homes are often dry. One way to raise the humidity — just for your cactus — is to place the pot with its drip pan on top of a small container filled with pebbles. Pour water over the pebbles, but do not allow the water to rise above the bottom of the top layer of pebbles. The water will evaporate, increasing the humidity around the cactus. Temperature and day length provide crucial bloom triggers for the Christmas cactus. The term for this response is "thermo-photoperiodic." Flower buds will form if one of the following conditions is met: Uninterrupted darkness means NO light during the dark period, including lamp light within the home. Cover the cactus with a black cloth or plastic bag, or place it in a closet. Pay attention to the light schedule, and do not fertilize or overwater. When do you want blooms — for Christmas or Thanksgiving? Count backward eight weeks to determine the autumn date to begin to prepare the plant for reblooming. When buds appear, increase the number of times that you water, but not the volume of water used. Too much water may cause buds to fall, as will moving the pot around. The Christmas cactus will remain in flower for four to six weeks, with each flower lasting six to nine days. After the plant has flowered, prune back each stem by pinching off enough sections to achieve a uniform habit. Resume normal watering and fertilization when new growth appears. Christmas cacti require direct sunlight, but take precautions against the burning midday summer sun: If you choose to leave your plant indoors during the warm months, move it a few feet away from the window to avoid burning the stems. If the plant is moved outdoors, it still needs protection when the sun is at its zenith.

Amazing new features now search on Google and Youtube using just your voice instead of typing. - 148Apps : "The benefit to being to straightforward is that Voice Assistant is incredibly easy to use after some initial setup. Anyone can transfer their words to their Twitter account, SMS, and more with virtually no effort." - Lifehacker : "Voice Assistant Translates Your Voice into Text and Sends It to Virtually Any Other iPhone/iPad App" Voice Assistant is an easy-to-use voice recognition application  that allows you to easily speak and instantly see your text or email messages. In fact, it’s up to five (5) times faster than typing on the keyboard. With Voice Assistant you can also dictate status updates directly to your Social Networking applications (Facebook and Twitter)….all using your voice.  So when you’re on-the-go, stop typing and start speaking – from short text messages to longer email messages, and anything in between.  * The application is based on an intelligent speech recognition that improves with time. * A convenient way to send SMS messages, emails, update your Facebook or post messages on Twitter * Voice-to-text transcriptions that may be sent as SMS, Email, or pasted into any application using the clipboard We're very happy to share with you the latest version of Voice Assistant. We have been working so hard to deliver you with the best in class user experience, stunning design, and a very precise voice recognition. The list goes on and on. We rather let you discover the new app by yourself and let us know what you think of this new version. We really hope you will enjoy this new edition as much as we did while creating every piece of it. I've been using Voice Assistant for about 4 or 5 months, & so far I'm pretty pleased with it.  Pros: It works pretty darn fast, good for long text, helpful since my eyes are bad & keeps me from having to use keyboard.  Cons: In a recent update, they changed the icons for record, send, trash, & delete, and also the background color behind those. The icons are to light - they are to hard to see with old eyes like mine. They need to darken the background color so icons are easier to see. Also, they took away the "recording" notification when you're re-recording a message, so you just have to go on blind faith that its actually recording, & sometimes it's not, so you have to redo it. :/ This app is amazing, but it could use some adjustments.. We should be able to access our regular apps instead of just our games and iMessage. Otherwise, this app is great!!! Why can't There be a pop up AFTER you finish and export your work. I accidentally hit the done button right after I was finished with my WHOLE PAPER and instantly lost everything. There can at least be an "are you sure" button!!! Also it will take just as much time as typing whatever you are going to type because it does not add periods, commas, quotes, capital letters, proper nouns or anything like that. Don't get this app. Waste of $2.99. Please take my advice. , has not provided details about its privacy practices and handling of data to Apple.

 that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions. Sometimes the term " . In some cases, online chat programs are exclusively for entertainment purposes. Some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistants questions, control home automation devices and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, and calendars with verbal (spoken?) commands. As of 2017, the capabilities and usage of virtual assistants are expanding rapidly, with new products entering the market and a strong emphasis on both email and   has over 100 million engagements via its email and sms interface Intelligent Virtual Assistants for business.
 In 1952 Bell Labs presented “Audrey”, the Automatic Digit Recognition machine. It occupied a six- foot-high relay rack, consumed substantial power, had streams of cables and exhibited the myriad maintenance problems associated with complex vacuum-tube circuitry. It could recognize the fundamental units of speech, phonemes. It was limited to accurate recognition of digits spoken by designated talkers. It could therefore be used for voice dialing, but in most cases push-button dialing was cheaper and faster, rather than speaking the consecutive digits. Another early tool which was enabled to perform digital speech recognition was the   after its initial market launch in 1961. This early computer, developed almost 20 years before the introduction of the first   in the 1960s. It was created to "demonstrate that the communication between man and machine was superficial".  ELIZA used pattern matching and substitution methodology into scripted responses to simulate conversation, which gave an illusion of understanding on the part of the program.
 Weizenbaum's own secretary reportedly asked Weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and ELIZA could have a real conversation. Weizenbaum was surprised by this, later writing: "I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people. , the tendency to unconsciously assume computer behaviors are analogous to human behaviors; that is, anthropomorphisation, a phenomenon present in human interactions with Virtual Assistants.
 The next milestone in the development of voice recognition technology was achieved in the 1970s at the   agency, funded five years of a Speech Understanding Research program, aiming to reach a minimum vocabulary of 1,000 words. Companies and academia including IBM, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and Stanford Research Institute took part in the program.
 The result was "Harpy", it mastered about 1000 words, the vocabulary of a three-year-old and it could understand sentences. It could process speech that followed pre-programmed vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar structures to determine which sequences of words made sense together, and thus reducing speech recognition errors.
 In 1986 Tangora was an upgrade of the Shoebox, it was a voice recognizing typewriter. Named after the world’s fastest typist at the time, it had a vocabulary of 20,000 words and used prediction to decide the most likely result based on what was said in the past. IBM’s approach was based on a  , which adds statistics to digital signal processing techniques. The method makes it possible to predict the most likely   to follow a given phoneme. Still each speaker had to individually train the typewriter to recognize his or her voice, and pause between each word.
 The 1990s digital speech recognition technology became a feature of the personal computer with   and Lemout & Hauspie fighting for customers. Much later the market launch of the first   in 1994 laid the foundation for smart virtual assistants as we know them today.
  software could recognize and transcribe natural human speech without pauses between each word into a document at a rate of 100 words per minute. A version of Naturally Speaking is still available for download and it is still used today, for instance, by many doctors in the US and the UK to document their medical records.
 . While entirely text-based SmarterChild was able to play games, check the weather, look up facts, and converse with users to an extent.  Its aim was to aid in tasks such as sending a text message, making phone calls, checking the weather or setting up an alarm. Over time, it has developed to provide restaurant recommendations, search the internet, and provide driving directions.

 To activate a virtual assistant using the voice, a wake word might be used. This is a word or groups of words such as "Hey Siri", "OK Google" or "Hey Google", "Alexa", and "Hey Microsoft".  As virtual assistants become more popular, there are increasing legal risks involved.  support to customers. It provides quick responses, which enhances a customer's experience.
 Amazon enables Alexa "Skills" and Google "Actions", essentially apps that run on the assistant platforms.
 Virtual assistants have a variety of privacy concerns associated with them. Features such as activation by voice pose a threat, as such features requires the device to always be listening.  Modes of privacy such as the virtual security button have been proposed to create a multilayer authentication for virtual assistants. Google Assistant does not store your data without your permission. To store the audio, you can go to Voice & Audio Activity (VAA) and turn on this feature. Your audio files are sent to cloud and used by Google to improve the performance of Google Assistant, but only if you have turned on the VAA feature. Amazon’s Virtual Assistant Alexa only listens to your conversation when you use its wake word (like Alexa, Amazon, Echo). It starts recording the conversation after the call of a wake word. It stops listening after 8 seconds of silence. It sends the recorded conversation to the cloud. You can delete your recording from the cloud by visiting ‘Alexa Privacy’ in ‘Alexa’. You can stop Alexa from listening to your conversations using ‘mute’ feature of Alexa, after muting the device, it cannot listen to you even if you use the wake words (like Alexa). Apple does not record your audio to improve Siri, it uses transcripts instead. It only sends data which is important for analysis, for instance, if you ask Siri to read your message it won’t send the message to the cloud, the machine will directly read the message without server’s interference. Users can opt-out anytime if they don’t want Siri to send the transcripts in the cloud. Added value of the Virtual Assistants can come among others from the following :
 Graphical sum up of the study capturing reasons of interest of Virtual assistants for consumers , criticized artificial intelligence and virtual assistants in particular in the following way:
 At a first level the fact that the consumer provides free data for the training and improvement of the virtual assistant, often without knowing it, is ethically disturbing.
 But at a second level, it might be even more ethically disturbing to know how these   However, this data needs to be labelled through a human process, which explains the rise of   in the last decade. That is, remotely using some people worldwide doing some repetitive and very simple tasks for a few cents, such as listening to Virtual Assistant speech data, and writing down what was said. Microwork has been criticized for the job insecurity it causes, and for the total lack of regulation: The average salary was 1,38  . Hence, Virtual Assistants and their designers are controversial for spurring job insecurity, and the AIs they propose are still human in the way that they would be impossible without the microwork of millions of human workers. Privacy concerns are raised by the fact that voice commands are available to the providers of virtual assistants in unencrypted form, and can thus be shared with third parties and be processed in an unauthorized or unexpected manner.  Additionally to the linguistic content of recorded speech, a user’s manner of expression and voice characteristics can implicitly contain information about his or her biometric identity, personality traits, body shape, physical and mental health condition, sex, gender, moods and emotions, socioeconomic status and geographical origin. In previous generations of text chat-based virtual assistants, the assistant was often represented by an  Digital experiences enabled by virtual assistants are considered to be among the major recent technological advances and most promising consumer trends. Experts claim that digital experiences will achieve a status-weight comparable to ‘real’ experiences, if not become more sought-after and prized.  The trend is verified by a high number of frequent users and the substantial growth of worldwide user numbers of virtual digital assistants. In mid-2017, the number of frequent users of digital virtual assistants is estimated to be around 1 bn worldwide.  In addition, it can be observed that virtual digital assistant technology is no longer restricted to smartphone applications, but present across many industry sectors (incl.  
In response to the significant R&D expenses of firms across all sectors and an increasing implementation of mobile devices, the market for speech recognition technology is predicted to grow at a   of 34.9% globally over the period of 2016 to 2024 and thereby surpass a global market size of US$7.5 billion by 2024.  study, the "native digital assistant installed base" is projected to exceed the world's population by 2021, with 7.5 billion active voice AI–capable devices.  According to Ovum, by that time "Google Assistant will dominate the voice AI–capable device market with 23.3% market share, followed by Samsung's Bixby (14.5%), Apple's Siri (13.1%), Amazon's Alexa (3.9%), and Microsoft's Cortana (2.3%)." Taking into consideration the regional distribution of market leaders, North American companies (e.g.  ) are expected to dominate the industry over the next years, due to the significant impact of BYOD ( ) and enterprise mobility business models. Furthermore, the increasing demand for smartphone-assisted platforms are expected to further boost the North American Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA) industry growth. Despite its smaller size in comparison to the North American market, the intelligent virtual assistant industry from the   is predicted to grow at an annual growth rate of 40% (above global average) over the 2016–2024 period. Virtual assistants should not be only seen as a gadget for individuals, as they could have a real economic utility for enterprises. As an example, a virtual assistant can take the role of an always available assistant with an encyclopedic knowledge. And which can organize meetings, check inventories, verify informations. Virtual Assistants are all the more important that their integration in small and middle-sized enterprises often consists in an easy first step through the more global adaptation and use of  . Indeed IoT technologies are first perceived by small and medium-sized enterprises as technologies of critical importance, but too complicated, risky or costly to be used. , published a paper that showed audio commands undetectable for the human ear could be directly embedded into music or spoken text, thereby manipulating virtual assistants into performing certain actions without the user taking note of it.  The researchers made small changes to audio files, which cancelled out the sound patterns that speech recognition systems are meant to detect. These were replaced with sounds that would be interpreted differently by the system and command it to dial phone numbers, open websites or even transfer money. In addition to unintentional actions and voice recording, another security and privacy risk associated with intelligent virtual assistants is malicious voice commands: An attacker who impersonates a user and issues malicious voice commands to, for example, unlock a smart door to gain unauthorized entry to a home or garage or order items online without the user's knowledge. Although some IVAs provide a voice-training feature to prevent such impersonation, it can be difficult for the system to distinguish between similar voices. Thus, a malicious person who is able to access an IVA-enabled device might be able to fool the system into thinking that they are the real owner and carry out criminal or mischievous acts.

Voice Assistants: How Artificial Intelligence Assistants Are Changing Our Lives Every Day For most of us, the ultimate luxury would be an assistant who always listens for your call, anticipates your every need, and takes action when necessary. That luxury is now available thanks to artificial intelligence assistants, aka voice assistants. Voice assistants come in somewhat small packages and can perform a variety of actions after hearing a wake word or command. They can turn on lights, answer questions, play music, place online orders, etc. Voice assistants are not to be confused with virtual assistants, which are people who work remotely and can therefore handle all kinds of tasks. Rather, voice assistants are technology based. As voice assistants become more robust, their utility in both the personal and business realms will grow as well. In this article, you’ll learn everything you need to know to leverage voice assistant technology in both consumer and business environments. To call any technology that makes our lives easier by one name is almost impossible. There are a variety of terms that refer to agents that can perform tasks or services for an individual, and they are almost interchangeable — but not quite. They differ mainly based on how we interact with the technology, the app, or a combination of both. : This is software that can assist people with basic tasks, usually using natural language. Intelligent personal assistants can go online and search for an answer to a user’s question. Either text or voice can trigger an action. : This term usually refers to the types of physical items that can provide various services by using smart speakers that listen for a wake word to become active and perform certain tasks. Amazon’s Echo, Google’s Home, and Apple’s HomePod are types of smart assistants. : These are automated software applications or platforms that assist the user by understanding natural language in either written or spoken form. : Text is the main way to get assistance from a chatbot. Chatbots can simulate a conversation with a human user. Many companies use them in the customer service sector to answer basic questions and connect with a live person if necessary. : The key here is voice. A voice assistant is a digital assistant that uses voice recognition, speech synthesis, and natural language processing (NLP) to provide a service through a particular application. For the purpose of this discussion, the term voice assistant will be used interchangeably with the following related terms: intelligent personal assistant, automated personal assistant, smart assistant, and virtual digital assistant. Many devices we use every day utilize voice assistants. They’re on our smartphones and inside smart speakers in our homes. Many mobile apps and operating systems use them. Additionally, certain technology in cars, as well as in retail, education, healthcare, and telecommunications environments, can be operated by voices. Technology is constantly advancing and changing, and the voice assistant market will progress along with it. In April 2015, the research firm   predicted that by the end of 2018, 30 percent of interactions with technology would be through “conversations” with smart machines, many of them by voice. Tractica is a market intelligence firm that focuses on human interaction with technology. Their   say unique consumer users for virtual digital assistants (which they define as automated software applications or platforms that assist the human user through understanding natural language in written or spoken form) will grow from more than 390 million worldwide users in 2015 to 1.8 billion by the end of 2021. The growth in the business world is expected to increase from 155 million users in 2015 to 843 million by 2021. With that kind of projected growth, revenue is forecasted to grow from $1.6 billion in 2015 to $15.8 billion in 2021. ., between 2016 and 2024, the market share for the technology will grow at an annual rate of almost 35 percent. More and more sectors of the economy, like healthcare and the automotive industry, are finding uses for the speech recognition technology in addition to those found in devices like smart speakers and phones. Siri by Apple became the first digital virtual assistant to be standard on a smartphone when the iPhone 4s came out on October 4, 2011. Siri moved into the smart speaker world when the HomePod debuted in February 2018. Google Now (which became Google Assistant) on the Android platform followed. It also works on Apple’s iOS, but has limited functionality. Then the smart speakers came along, and “Alexa” and “Hey Google” became a part of many household conversations. Alexa by Amazon is part of the Echo and the Dot. Google Assistant is part of the Google Home. Samsung has Bixby. IBM has Watson. Microsoft has Cortana on its Windows 10, Xbox One machines, and Windows phones, and Nuance has Nina. Facebook used to have M, but its usage in the Facebook Messenger app ended in January 2018. By default, most of the voice assistants have somewhat female-sounding voices, although the user can change them to other voices. Many people refer to Siri, Alexa, and Cortana as “she” and not “it.” Developers are constantly creating new features for voice assistants, which further integrates them into our lives. In the 2013 movie Her, a man developed such an intense relationship with his female voice assistant that he fell in love with her. Critics loved the film, and it received numerous award nominations, including Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations. An intelligent personal assistant can help someone with basic tasks. They often understand natural language and can help with things like creating meeting requests, reporting a sports score, and sharing the weather forecast. Intelligent personal assistants have access to a large amount of information on a device or online, which enables them to perform simple tasks. Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, Amazon Alexa, and others are examples of intelligent personal assistants. Voice recognition technology was around long before Apple’s Siri debuted in 2011. At the Seattle World’s Fair in 1962, IBM presented a tool called Shoebox. It was the size of a shoebox and could perform mathematical functions and recognize 16 spoken words as well as digits 0-9. In the 1970s, scientists at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — with the substantial support of the United States Department of Defense and its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) — created Harpy. It could recognize 1,011 words, which is about the vocabulary of a three-year-old. Once organizations came up with inventions that could recognize word sequences, companies began to build applications for the technology. The Julie doll from the Worlds of Wonder toy company came out in 1987 and could recognize a child’s voice and respond to it. Throughout the 1990s, companies like IBM, Apple, and others created items that used voice recognition. Apple began building speech recognition features into its Macintosh computers with PlainTalk in 1993. In April 1997, Dragon came out with Dragon NaturallySpeaking, which was the first continuous dictation product. It could understand about 100 words per minute and turn it into text. Medical dictation devices were one of the earliest adopters of voice recognition technology. Technology companies are working to create increasingly sophisticated technology that will automate more processes and tasks we do throughout the day. Even Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa can “learn” new words and tasks. As technology evolves, the ways people interact with it also changes. Think about how internet searches have become easier. It wasn’t long ago that an internet search had to be very specific and would often yield strange and unrelated results. Now, it seems like search engines, such as Google, can almost read your mind and know exactly what you are looking for. Engines understand context and the intent of your search. Artificial intelligence assistants have also evolved. Early on, text was the only way to interact with an assistant app (typing in a phrase triggered a response). Now, voice has taken over. Assistant apps or smart speakers are always listening for their wake words. By default, the words “Hey Siri,” “OK Google,” “Hey Google,” and “Alexa” are the standards on their respective devices, but users can personalize their wake words to some degree. “Alexa” can become “Echo,” “Amazon,” or simply “computer.” The ability to make these adjustments can be especially helpful if someone named Alex or Alexis lives in the home. Wake words rely on a special algorithm that is always listening for a particular word or phrase so that a phone, smart speaker, or something else can begin communicating with a server to do its job. Wake words need to be long enough to be distinct, easy for a human to speak, and simple for a machine to recognize. This is why you cannot change your wake word to anything you want it to be.   Voice assistants don’t really “understand” what you’re saying — they just listen for their wake word and then begin communicating with a server to complete a task. NLP is a form of artificial intelligence that helps technology interpret human language. Voice assistants allow us to do a variety of tasks hands-free, which is a major reason many people like using them, especially on their phones. Apple has Siri. Google phones and most Androids have Google. Samsung has Bixby. Windows phones have Cortana.  in May 2017 showed that nearly half of all adults in the United States use voice-controlled digital assistants on their smartphones and other devices. Voice assistants can make calls, send text messages, look things up online, provide directions, open apps, set appointments on our calendars, and initiate or complete many other tasks. With the addition of separate apps on the phone, our voice can be a type of remote control for our lives. We can unlock cars and homes, turn on lights, adjust the thermostat, change the television channel, and much more. When Siri debuted on iPhones in 2011, she changed the world, transforming the way we used our phones and other technology. What Siri did for phones, Alexa did for homes, initiating the rise of the smart speaker. “Amazon was quietly working on it for two to three years,” says Ava Mutchler, Associate Editor of  , a site dedicated to everything about voice technology. The inspiration was Computer from the Star Trek series, a computer that listened and understood voice commands. Google caught up just a short time later. Consumers have been quick to respond to the technology, especially the lower-priced Amazon Echo Dot. “For under $100, you could give this technology a try,” Mutchler added.  revealed that almost 20 percent of U.S. adults (about 47.3 million) had a smart speaker in their home. Based on responses in the survey, that number is expected to rise rapidly. “It’s growing faster than even the web and mobile, and the adoption is faster. I think people are more open to new technology than they were before. It doesn’t seem foreign to us to talk to something. Voice is a very convenient way to communicate, especially with technology. The adoption is pretty remarkable across all age groups,” Mutchler says. Also, smart speakers are cheaper than smartphones, so it’s less of an investment to try one. People use smart speakers for a variety of functions. At the bottom of the utilization chart below, you’ll notice that only 26 percent of smart speaker owners make a purchase using the smart speaker. However, almost 12 percent of those users purchase something monthly, so there is plenty of room for growth. “People need to get comfortable with using voice assistants to order stuff,” Mutchler notes, adding that it’s easier to order things like toilet paper than it is to order something like a ski boot when using a voice assistant. With a voice assistant, you can’t see a boot or read a description about it. You have to blindly trust the recommendation, which is difficult for many people to do. Even as the home market for smart speakers is booming, the business world has been slow to adopt the technology. But, it’s coming. “Voice technology is still brand new. It might not feel like it if you’re an early adopter, but it is,” says Tony Lucas, Director of Product, Smartsheet. There are not yet many applications for business use, but subsidiaries like   (owned by Smartsheet) make it easier for non-developers to build and automate services they need. Many current apps just aren’t practical in the business world. “You’re not going to have a group of people all sitting in front of a computer and talking to a voice assistant. It won’t work, and it doesn’t make sense,” Lucas explains. Since everyone is at a computer anyway, it makes more sense to do something the old-fashioned way (i.e., via a text-based search). But voice assistants could change the way many places do business. Lucas uses the example of a laboratory where people have to wear thick gloves and bodysuits for safety and contamination reasons. It isn’t practical for them to type anything or push buttons to make something happen, but voice technology could change everything by automating tasks. Also, many tasks that require automation are not readily available. “Companies need to build a specific skill that a business wants. They do not exist off the shelf,” Lucas emphasizes. In order to keep development costs down, the applications should be generic enough to perform a wide variety of business tasks. Some business systems do not allow the technology. For example, some purchasing departments require payment with invoices and purchase orders, so those companies cannot utilize the technology to order something directly that is popular with smart speakers. There are also hurdles because voice technology is far ahead of regulations and requirements. Unlike general consumers, businesses need to consider things like access authorization, archiving, and records management. For the companies that do embrace the technology, many employees use smart speakers for various tasks during meetings. If someone needs to know a fact or an address, the voice assistant can search for that data and give a response. It can also take notes, record action items, set meetings on calendars, and create to-do and follow-up lists, all of which save time and keep people focused on the meeting. “A lot of what this comes down to is context switching. If you have one conversation, go to do something else, and then try to come back, you lose something,” Lucas says. Being able to ask a voice assistant for a sales figure or a report eliminates the need for a person who is in the meeting to take their attention away from the meeting to find a report. In addition, if AI assistants have access to company databases, they can compile statistics, automate tasks, and turn dictations into text reports. “I think the voice is going to be the single biggest game changer since the web in terms of how consumers interact with services. Voice assistants are going to take people away from screens,” Lucas predicts. “This is going to take years. We’re still in day one with this stuff, which is exciting. So many things have been consumer-driven first and then moved into the business world,” he adds. As the acceptance and usage of voice assistants continues to grow, it is only natural for some people to have reservations about using them. Below, we discuss some of the major issues regarding voice assistants. : Privacy is a concern, especially involving smart speakers. While waiting for a wake word, smart speakers are always listening. On a smartphone, pressing a button or opening an app activates the assistant. Once you wake it up, it begins recording audio clips of what you say. These clips represent the files that go to a server to process the audio and formulate a response. The real brains are not in the little speakers in our homes: They’re on a massive server somewhere else. What the speaker sends is on an encrypted connection. Speakers do not record anything prior to the wake words. 
	“People confuse ‘always listening’ with ‘always recording,’” says Mutchler of Voicebot.ai. “The genius of [smart speakers] is they can remove background noise and single out the wake word,” she continues. Only then do they begin recording. 
	Smart speakers and other AI assistants, like those on a smartphone, save these recordings and allow the user to go into their account and delete them. 
	There are also questions about what can happen with those recordings. One situation that raises these privacy concerns is using the recordings as possible evidence in a criminal investigation. Back in 2016, detectives in an Arkansas murder case found an Amazon Echo linked to many smart home devices at a murder scene. Police seized the Echo and tried to get information from it by serving a warrant to Amazon for records of any recordings on the device. Amazon did not release the information, and it is unclear what law enforcement expected to get from the smart speaker and its files. 
	Laws surrounding information on our phones and devices are struggling to keep up with the ever-changing technology and how we use it. There are even questions about whether smart speakers and other devices should have a mechanism to report dangerous words, search patterns, or activity to authorities. What happens if someone asks a voice assistant to do something illegal? Should it be able to override our commands? These issues and others are sure to be the subjects of new laws as the technology continues to change. 
	Even though smart speaker usage is growing amongst all age groups, younger people don’t seem to have as much of a problem with privacy as older ones. “I think we’re so used to having our privacy invaded for convenience,” Mutchler says. 
	Lucas points out that twenty years ago, the thought of having an ever-listening speaker in our homes wouldn’t have boded well with consumers. But our lines of concern are different than they once were. “You’ll accept all of these things because they are helpful,” he says. : Voice assistants don’t always understand what we are asking. Sometimes, it’s how we speak. Other times, it is simply because the artificial intelligence hasn’t yet learned how to do something.  from the consulting company Stone Temple used 5,000 questions to test the accuracy of Google Assistant, Cortana, Siri, and Alexa. Google got the most correct responses. 
	There is also a question concerning answer sources. During an online search, a user can select results, note the source, and click for more information. When asking a voice assistant a question, the answer usually comes back as fact, often without stating the source. 
	The “conversations” people have with their voice assistants are not really two way at all. To ask a follow-up question, you need to wake the assistant up again. Also, real people need to monitor the artificial intelligence in order for it to “learn” new things. Hackability and Security: Even though voice assistants communicate with their servers using encrypted connections, there is still a concern about hackability and security. 
	In early 2018, some users of Amazon’s Echo reported it would suddenly emit an evil laugh for no reason. In the beginning, people thought someone had hacked into their smart speakers. Amazon investigated the problem and later announced that the Echo had been hearing words similar to “Alexa laugh,” so it began laughing. As a response, Amazon disabled the reaction and changed Alexa’s response to a user’s request that it laugh to “Sure, I can laugh,” followed by laughter. 
	Since some smart speakers can recognize and respond to any nearby voice, a guest can check or alter your calendar or your contacts. Also, an annoyed neighbor can set an alarm for an early morning wake-up call by yelling through your door. 
	With regard to this capability, be careful not to link door locks and security systems to voice assistants. If you do, a burglar could just as easily say “unlock the front door” or “disable security cameras” as you could. 
	Someone could also use your device to make purchases without you knowing about it. In order to avoid this possibility, Alexa allows you to set a PIN confirmation option for voice purchases. 
	For business, the security concerns are a bit different. Lucas uses the following example: In the past, burglars would break into the CEO’s office and steal documents, like sales data and earnings reports. Businesses adapted security procedures. Then, companies began storing information on computers, so hacking into files became the crime. Businesses adapted security procedures. Now, a thief can simply ask a voice assistant for critical data. Security procedures need to adapt. “I think it’s quite likely you will see enterprise solutions coming out. They might be based on consumer technology but with add-ons,” Lucas says. The battle for voice assistant market share is fierce. Amazon was first with the Echo, but Google burst onto the scene and was able to gain market share quickly in the United States. Google had experience with searches, languages, and data, so they had the ability to quickly jump into the smart speaker market, Mutchler explains. Apple’s HomePod is lagging behind, mostly because of features, the same factor that hinders Siri on iPhones. “She’s not open to developers. She’s very restrained,” Mutchler says. Google Assistant spoke many languages from the very beginning, something Alexa had to learn how to do. Google Home was the first to go on sale outside the U.S., and Amazon Echo was the first to offer commerce. Both companies have always understood multiple voices and can differentiate between them. Siri has not. When one company unveils a new feature, the others are usually not too far behind. In the beginning, making calls to a phone was not something smart speakers could do. Now, they can. Today, all options can play music, add items to calendars, perform searches, send messages, answer questions, control some smart devices, and much more. “It’s a constant feature game. Creating a voice assistant is more difficult than people think. They [competitors] make each other better,” Mutchler emphasizes. Smart speaker companies do not make money on the sales of the hardware; the money is in how we will use smart speakers in the future. The key is getting people on board with a brand early, much like with smartphones. “Once you start with one assistant, you might not go back and try another one. It’s difficult to get people to switch,” Mutchler suggests. If the available bots don’t perform all the tasks you want them to, it is possible to build your own. For a text-based bot, you don’t even need to know how to code. There are apps available to help people create assistants that can automate tasks or events. Creating a voice activated bot is much more difficult. That’s where companies like Converse.AI. “We make it easier for non-developers to build and automate the services that they need. No coding experience is required,” Lucas says. A text-based bot automates tasks and interacts with customers. It can also help answer questions for clients, access databases, and help customers help themselves. For more information about customer self-service portals, many of which use bots, read  If you choose to create a bot, make sure it’s representative of your brand. Also, make sure it works, since technology will not do your business any good if it doesn’t help customers. “The danger is that people will try it, it won’t work, and they won’t go back,” Mutchler warns. She mentions Samsung’s Bixby, which debuted on the Galaxy S8 phone but was not fully functional when it came out. Many customers tried it a few times, then asked Samsung to develop a way to disable it, which they did in a software update. Building a bot takes time, so it’s better not to rush it. Focus on doing a few things extraordinarily well instead of trying to do many things (and, therefore, doing them unsuccessfully). Also, remember to update the bot as necessary. It’s not a “build it and leave it” venture. The number of people using voice assistants is expected to grow. According to the Voicebot Smart Speaker Consumer Adoption Report 2018, almost ten percent of people who do not own a smart speaker plan to purchase one. If this holds true, the user base of smart speaker users will grow 50 percent, meaning a quarter of adults in the United States will own a smart speaker. Smart speaker sales are expanding in other parts of the world, meaning they need to “learn” how to “understand” languages, accents, dialects, slang, and nuances in each country in which they are sold. Chinese companies are developing their own smart speakers. “The rest of the world is behind the U.S. and will catch up pretty quickly,” Mutchler says. Voice assistants are always improving and “learning.” AI companies use data from existing systems to improve what assistants can do. Lucas believes that ultimately, the voice assistant might get so smart that it will automatically order a pizza if you say you’re hungry. It will use existing data from your previous purchases to come to the conclusion that saying you’re hungry equals ordering a pizza. The experts predict that voice assistants will improve in many other ways. As described in a 2017  , “A subfield of AI called computational creativity forges algorithms that can write music, paint portraits, and tell jokes.” These capabilities will help smart speakers “show emotion” and “think” for themselves without being scripted. Systems that explain why they did what they did and what they’re going to do next are also on the horizon. Voice assistants are not going anywhere. “I think people thought of it as a fad, but it’s not. It’s changing what people do in their homes. Voice assistants will grow and are here to stay,” Mutchler says. “I think they [voice assistants] will be in everything, and the smart speaker might fade away in a few years because many technologies, like televisions and refrigerators, will have their own voice assistants. The kids today won’t understand that there was a world where you couldn’t talk to things,” she concludes.

                alt="Blackbough Swim">  Every body is a bikini body with the right attitude, and we love seeing you rock yours!  
If your Designated Mate is widely feared, the beauties at the house party where you’ve gone undercover to meet him will be especially kind. Kindness feels good, even when it’s based on a false notion of your identity and purpose. Posing as a beauty means not reading what you would like to read on a rocky shore in the South of France. Even a powerful man will be briefly self-conscious when he first disrobes to his bathing suit. It is technically impossible for a man to look better in a Speedo than in swim trunks. When you know that a person is violent and ruthless, you will see violent ruthlessness in such basic things as his swim stroke. “What are you doing?” from your Designated Mate amid choppy waves after he has followed you into the sea may or may not betray suspicion. A hundred feet of blue-black Mediterranean will allow you ample time to deliver a strong self-lecture. “We ask of you an impossible combination of traits: ironclad scruples and a willingness to violate them; “An abiding love for your country and a willingness to consort with individuals who are working actively to destroy it; “The instincts and intuition of experts, and the blank records and true freshness of ingénues. “You will each perform this service only once, after which you will return to your lives. “We cannot promise that your lives will be exactly the same when you go back to them.” Eagerness and pliability can be expressed even in the way you climb from the sea onto chalky yellow rocks. “You’re a very fast swimmer,” uttered by a man who is still submerged, may not be intended as praise. “Well? What do you think about that?” suggests a preference for direct verbal responses over giggling. “I like it” must be uttered with enough gusto to compensate for a lack of declarative color.  sure” is acceptable only when followed, coyly, with “You’ll have to convince me.” Throwing back your head and closing your eyes allows you to give the appearance of sexual readiness while concealing revulsion. Being alone with a violent and ruthless man, surrounded by water, can make the shore seem very far away. You may feel solidarity, at such a time, with the beauties just visible there in their bright bikinis. Remind yourself that you aren’t being paid when he climbs out of the water and lumbers toward you. Remind yourself that you aren’t being paid when he leads you behind a boulder and pulls you onto his lap. The Dissociation Technique is like a parachute—you must pull the cord at the correct time. You will be tempted to pull the cord when he surrounds you with arms whose bulky strength reminds you, fleetingly, of your husband’s. You will be tempted to pull it when you feel him start to move against you from below. You will be tempted to pull it when his smell envelops you: metallic, like a warm hand clutching pennies. “No one can see us” suggests that your discomfort has been understood as fear of physical exposure. “Relax, relax,” uttered in rhythmic, throaty tones, suggests that your discomfort is not unwelcome. With each number, imagine yourself rising out of your body and moving one step farther away from it. By five, you should be floating a foot or two above your body, feeling only vague anxiety over what is about to happen to it. By one, your mind should drift so free that you lose track of what is happening below. The sound of waves against rocks existed millennia before there were creatures who could hear it. Spurs and gashes of stone narrate a violence that the earth itself has long forgotten. Return to your body carefully, as if you were reëntering your home after a hurricane. Focus instead on gauging your Designated Mate’s reaction to the new intimacy between you. “Where did you learn to swim like that?,” uttered lazily, while supine, with two fingers in your hair, indicates curiosity.  grow up?,” asked of a man who has just asked you the same thing, is known as “mirroring.” “Come. Let’s go back,” uttered brusquely, suggests that your Designated Mate has no more wish to talk about himself than you do. You will see knowledge of your new intimacy with your Designated Mate in the eyes of every beauty on shore. “We saved lunch for you” may or may not be an allusion to the reason for your absence. When you are in conversation with a beauty, it is essential that you be perceived as no more or less than she is. If married, say that you and your spouse have divorced, to give an impression of unfettered freedom. “Oh, that’s sad!” suggests that the beauty you’re chatting with would like to marry. you’re chatting with would like to marry. Taking his hand and smiling congenially can create a sense of low-key accompaniment. An abstracted smile in return, as if he’d forgotten who you are, may be a sign of pressing concerns. The room assigned to a powerful man will be more lavish than the one you slept in while awaiting his arrival. Determine whether your Designated Mate seeks physical intimacy; if not, feign the wish for a nap. Curling up under bedclothes, even those belonging to an enemy subject, may be soothing. Since beauties carry neither pocketbooks nor timepieces, you cannot credibly transport recording devices. A microphone has been implanted just beyond the first turn of your right ear canal. Activate the microphone by pressing the triangle of cartilage across your ear opening. In extreme quiet, or to a person whose head is adjacent to yours, this whine may be audible. Should the whine be detected, swat your ear as if to deflect a mosquito, hitting the on/off cartilage to deactivate the mike. Your job is proximity; if you are near your Designated Mate, recording his private speech, you are succeeding. If your subject is angry, you may leave your camouflage position and move as close to him as possible to improve recording quality. If your Designated Mate is standing on a balcony, hover in the doorway just behind him. If he pivots and discovers you, pretend that you were on the verge of approaching him. If your subject brushes past you and storms out of the room, slamming the door, you have eluded detection. If your Designated Mate leaves your company a second time, don’t follow him again. Your Subcutaneous Pulse System issues pings so generic that detection would reveal neither source nor intent. A button is embedded behind the inside ligament of your right knee (if right-handed). You will reflect on the fact that your husband, coming from a culture of tribal allegiance, understands and applauds your patriotism. You will reflect on the enclosed and joyful life that the two of you have shared since graduate school. You will reflect on the fact that America is your husband’s chosen country, and that he loves it. You will reflect on the fact that your husband’s rise to prominence would have been unimaginable in any other nation. You will reflect on your joint conviction that your service had to be undertaken before you had children. You will reflect on the fact that you are thirty-three, and have spent your professional life fomenting musical trends. You will reflect on the fact that you must return home the same person you were when you left. You will reflect on the fact that you had stopped being that person even before leaving. You will reflect on the fact that these “instructions” are becoming less and less instructive. Your Field Instructions, stored in a chip beneath your hairline, will serve as both a mission log and a guide for others undertaking this work. Pressing your left thumb (if right-handed) against your left middle fingertip begins recording. Always filter your observations and experience through the lens of their didactic value. When your mission is complete, you may view the results of the download before adding your Field Instructions to your mission file. As a beauty, you will be expected to return to your room and change clothes often; a fresh appearance at mealtimes is essential. Gold spike-heeled sandals may compromise your ability to run or jump, but they look good on tanned feet. Registering as “young” is especially welcome to those who may not register as “young” much longer. If your Designated Mate leads you to dinner with an arm at your waist, assume that your attire change was successful. “How long have you been divorced?” suggests the wish to resume a prior conversation. “Very black” is somewhat less gentle, especially when accompanied by a pointed stare. “Yes. It is nice” contradicts one’s alleged divorce. “Was nice” is a reasonable correction. “But not nice enough?,” with laughter, indicates friendly intimacy. Especially when followed by “Or too nice!” For most beauties, the lure of food is a hazard; as a beauty of limited tenure, you may eat what you want. Squab can be consumed by ripping the bird apart with your hands and sucking the meat from the bones. A host who caters to violent guests will understand implicitly the need for discretion. If your job is to appear simpleminded, a confidence may mean that you have failed. Turning your ear toward your host’s mouth will prevent you from having to smell the breath coming from it. If your host warns you that your Designated Mate may pose an immediate danger to you, assume that your Designated Mate has left the room. If you have no idea in which direction your Designated Mate has gone, hold still. If you find yourself hovering beside a pair of glass doors, you may open them and step outside. If you were a child who loved the moon, looking at the moon will forever remind you of childhood. A vague story like “Your father died before you were born” may satisfy a curious child for an unlikely number of years. The truth of your paternity, discovered in adulthood, will make the lie seem retroactively ludicrous. It is especially not a comfort when the star in question has seven other children from three different marriages. Discovering that you are a movie star’s daughter may prompt you to watch upward of sixty movies, dating from the beginning of his career. A sudden reconfiguration of your past can change the fit and feel of your adulthood. It may cleave you, irreparably, from the mother whose single goal has been your happiness. If your husband has transformed greatly in his own life, he will understand your transformation. “There you are,” whispered from behind by your Designated Mate, suggests that he has been looking for you. The moon’s calm face can make you feel, in advance, that you are understood and forgiven. If you wish to avoid physical intimacy, the sight of a speedboat will bring relief, despite the myriad new problems it presents. If no words are exchanged between your Designated Mate and the speedboat’s captain, their meeting was likely prearranged. A man known for his cruelty may still show great care in guiding his beauty into a rocking speedboat. If your Personal Calming Source is the moon, be grateful that it is dark and that the moon is especially bright. You need to tell the movie star that he has an eighth child, and that she is a hero. When the captain of a boat adjusts his course in response to commands from your Designated Mate, he may not know where he is taking you. If your Designated Mate keeps looking up, he’s probably using the stars for navigation. A beauty should require no more context than the presence of her Designated Mate. Simulate said enjoyment by putting an affectionate arm around him and nestling your head close to his. A beauty whose head is aligned with her Designated Mate’s can share in his navigation and thus calculate the route. At night, far from shore, stars pulse with a strength that is impossible to conceive of in the proximity of light. Your whereabouts will never be a mystery; you will be visible at all times as a dot of light on the screens of those watching over you. Technology has afforded ordinary people a chance to glow in the cosmos of human achievement. Your lack of espionage and language training is what makes your record clean and neutral. You need not be remarkable for your credentials or skill sets, only for your bravery and equilibrium. In the new heroism, the goal is to renounce the American fixation with being seen and recognized. You’ll be surprised by what lies under it: a rich, deep crawl space of possibilities. Some liken this discovery to a dream in which a familiar home acquires new wings and rooms. The power of individual magnetism is nothing against the power of combined selfless effort. You may accomplish astonishing personal feats, but citizen agents rarely seek individual credit. They liken the need for personal glory to cigarette addiction: a habit that feels life-sustaining even as it kills you. An enemy of the state could not have connived a better way to declaw and distract us. After a juddering ride of several hours, you may not notice at first that the boat is approaching a shore. The speedboat’s immediate departure signals that you won’t be making a return trip anytime soon. A new remote and unfamiliar place can make the prior remote and unfamiliar place seem like home. Because your husband is a visionary in the realm of national security, he occasionally has access to that screen. If it calms you to imagine your husband tracking your dot of light, then imagine it. A formal handshake between your new host and your Designated Mate implies that this is their first meeting. A formal handshake followed by a complex and stylized hand gesture implies a shared allegiance. In certain rich, powerful men, physical slightness will seem a source of strength. The failure of your new host to acknowledge you may indicate that women do not register in his field of vision. As you enter the house, her cool scrutiny will ripple through the other beauties and surround you. The sensation will remind you of going as a child with your mother to visit families with two parents and multiple children. Once the new children were under your control, it was crushing to leave their midst. A small table and chairs carved into a spindly clifftop promontory are doubtless designed for private conversation. If your Designated Mate brings you with him to this place, it may mean that he feels less than perfectly at ease with your new host. When your new host dismisses his own alpha beauty, important business may be under way. An alpha beauty will not tolerate her own exclusion if another beauty is included. If your new host makes a motion of dismissal at you, look to your Designated Mate. If your Designated Mate keeps an arm around you in the face of your new host’s dismissal, you have become the object of a power play. If your new host moves close to your face and speaks directly into it, he is likely testing your ignorance of his language. If your Designated Mate stiffens beside you, your new host’s words are probably offensive. Your Designated Mate has prevailed in his claim that you’re too harmless to bother sending away. In the presence of business conversation, project an utter lack of interest or curiosity. On a high, narrow promontory at Latitude X, Longitude Y, the ocean and heavens shimmer in all directions. There will be moments in your mission, perhaps very few, when you’ll sense the imminence of critical information. This joy may arise from your discovery that the moon, hard and radiant, is still aloft. It may arise from the knowledge that, when your task is complete, you will return to the husband you adore. It may arise from the extremity of the natural beauty around you, and the recognition that you are alive in this moment. It may arise from your knowledge that you have accomplished every goal you’ve set for yourself since childhood. It may arise from the knowledge that at long last you’ve found a goal worthy of your considerable energies. It may arise from the knowledge that, by accomplishing this goal, you’ll have helped to perpetuate American life as you know it. Beware of internal states—positive or negative—that obscure what is happening around you. The camera implanted in your left eye is operated by pressing your left tear duct. In poor light, a flash may be activated by pressing the outside tip of your left eyebrow. When using the flash, always cover your non-camera eye to shield it from temporary blindness occasioned by the flash. Springing from your seat with a gasp and peering toward the house will focus the attention of others in that direction. Having heard something inaudible to others puts you in an immediate position of authority. “What? What did you hear?,” uttered close to your face by your Designated Mate, means that your diversion was successful. Wait until their eagerness to know verges on anger, evidenced by the shaking of your shoulders. Your Designated Mate’s glance toward the dock, far below, may reveal that his interests are not fully aligned with your new host’s. His attention to his handset may portend that your diversion has run amok, undermining the transaction you meant to capture. It is reasonable to hope that a backlit screen will distract its user from a camera flash at some slight distance. Move close to the sketches you wish to photograph, allowing them to fill your field of vision. An epithet in another language, followed by “What the fuck was that?,” means you overestimated your Designated Mate’s handset absorption. A bright, throbbing total blindness means that you neglected to cover your non-camera eye. Distance yourself from agency in the flash by crying out, truthfully, “I can’t see!” It is hard to defer said navigation when your Designated Mate is forcefully yanking your hand. Cooler air and a downward slope indicate that you are now below the cliff’s edge. Trying to negotiate a crumbling wooded path in a state of blindness (and heels) will soon lead to tripping and collapsing. Receding downhill footfalls indicate that you’ve overtaxed your limited value to your Designated Mate. A sense of helpless disorientation may prevent you from doing much more than sitting there in the dirt. Variegation in the textures around you is a first sign that your temporary blindness has begun to fade. In the aftermath of blindness, the accretion of objects around you may have an almost sensual quality. A boat departing at high speed will send a vibration trembling up through the soil. The knowledge that you are alone, without your Designated Mate, will settle upon you slowly and coldly. Each new phase of aloneness reveals that you were previously less alone than you thought. Recall that the mythical feats you loved to read about as a child are puny beside the accomplishments of human beings on earth. The discovery of another person at close range, when you thought you were alone, may occasion fear. “Bastard,” muttered bitterly, suggests familiarity with the phenomenon of being left behind. Sustaining an atmosphere of luxury in a remote place requires an enormous amount of money. A powerful man whose associate has fled the premises after a false alarm is unlikely to be cheerful. The reappearance of the vanished associate’s stranded beauty will likely startle him. “Where the fuck did he go?” is remarkably easy to decipher, even in a language you don’t recognize. An alpha beauty’s complete indifference to the consternation of her mate may mean that he’s easily moved to consternation. Generally, you will pass from the hands of a less powerful man to those of a more powerful man. If your vulnerability and helplessness have drawn the interest of an enemy subject, accentuate them. Scraped and dirty legs may accentuate your vulnerability to the point of disgust. If, after tending to your scrapes, you are shown to a bathing area with a stone-encrusted waterfall, assume you won’t be alone for long. The fact that a man has ignored and then insulted you does not mean that he won’t want to fuck you. By the time your forehead is jammed against a rock, you should perceive your body only vaguely, from above. If you feel, on returning to your body, that much time has passed, don’t dwell on how much. When you emerge from a warm, churning bath where you’ve spent an indeterminate period of time, expect to feel shaky and weak. Remind yourself that you are receiving no payment, in currency or kind, for this or any act you have engaged in. An abundance of diaphanous bathrobes suggests that the occupants of this bathroom are often female. A soiled and tattered white sundress can seem oddly precious when it’s all you have. The stationing of a male attendant outside the bathroom means that you haven’t been forgotten. If he shows you to a tiny room containing a very large bed, your utility to your new host may not have been exhausted. A tray containing a meat pie, grapes, and a pitcher of water suggests that visits such as yours are routine. At times, the moon may appear like a surveillance device, tracking your movements. Having awakened to find them absent, we may be left with a sense of having spoken with them. Even the most secure houses achieve, in deep night, a state of relative unconsciousness. A beauty in a diaphanous lavender bathrobe can go anywhere, as long as she appears to be delivering herself to someone. A universal principle of home construction makes it possible to guess which door will lead to the master bedroom. When trespassing in a sleeping man’s bedroom, go straight to his bed, as if you were seeking him out. An alpha beauty who has appeared to have no tie to your new host may turn out to be his intimate, after all. Their sleeping entanglement may contradict everything you have witnessed between them. The Sweet Spot is where he empties his pockets at the end of the day and stores the essentials he needs to begin the next. The Sweet Spot of a secretive, catlike man will most often be inside a cupboard or a drawer. When you find it, consider using a Data Surge to capture the contents of his handset. A Data Surge must be deployed with extreme caution, and only if you feel confident of an exceptional yield. The quantity of information captured will require an enormous amount of manpower to tease apart. Reach between your right fourth and pinky toes (if right-handed) and remove the Data Plug from your Universal Port. Attached to the plug is a cable with a connection pin at one end for insertion into the handset’s data port. A red ribbon has been tucked inside your Universal Port; enclose this in one of your palms. Spread apart your toes and gently reinsert the plug, now fused to your subject’s handset, into your Universal Port. Peeling an orange for your husband in bed on a Sunday, sunlight splashing the sheets; The purpose of the red ribbon is to orient you; if you awaken to find yourself clutching one, look to your foot. When your body is quiet, unplug the handset and return it to its original location. A Data Surge leaves a ringing in your ears that may obscure the sound of another person’s arrival. When an alpha beauty accosts you at high volume in an unfamiliar language, it may mean she’s too sleepy to remember who you are. Beauty status will not excuse, for another beauty, your appearance where you are not supposed to be. Should you be perceived as an enemy, prepare to defend yourself at the first sign of physical encroachment. Your new host lunging at you, shouting, “What the fuck are you doing?,” constitutes physical encroachment. Thrust your elbow upward into the tender socket underneath his jaw, sending him backward onto the floor. The wails of a newborn will lure its mother away from almost anything, including the physical travails of her mate. At the revelation of martial-arts expertise, a man who has perceived you as merely a beauty will recalculate your identity and purpose. Obstructing the path of a violent man to his firearm will nearly always result in another encroachment. Kicking him in the foreneck, even barefoot, will temporarily occlude his windpipe. The alpha beauty of a violent man will know where his firearm is kept, and how to use it. When self-preservation requires that you harm the innocent, we can provide no more than guidelines. As Americans, we value human rights above all else and cannot sanction their violation. Follow your instincts while bearing in mind that we must, and will, hew to our principles. A woman holding a thrashing baby in one arm may have trouble aiming a firearm with the other. If a person has shot at you and missed, incapacitate her before she can fire again. Assuming there is no artery involvement, wounds to the upper limbs are preferable. When shots have been fired in a powerful man’s home, you have minutes, if not seconds, before the arrival of security. Your physical person is our Black Box; without it, we have no record of what has happened on your mission. When you find yourself cornered and outnumbered, you may unleash, as a last resort, your Primal Roar. The Primal Roar is the human equivalent of an explosion, a sound that combines screaming, shrieking, and howling. The Roar must be accompanied by facial contortions and frenetic body movement, suggesting a feral, unhinged state. The goal is to horrify your opponent, the way trusted figures, turned evil, are horrifying in movies and in nightmares. When approached by a howling, spasmodic, flashing monster, most women holding newborns will step aside. Those stampeding to the aid of a powerful man will barely notice a dishevelled beauty they pass in a hallway. Resume your beauty role while running: smooth your hair and cover your bleeding wound with the sundress scrunched in your pocket. In residences of the violent rich, there will be at least one guard at each port of egress. In deep night, if you are extremely lucky (and quiet), that guard will be asleep. If running barefoot onto a dock transports you back to your childhood, pain may be making you hallucinate. Lying with girlfriends on a still-warm dock in upstate New York, watching shooting stars, is a sensation you remember after many years. Hindsight creates the illusion that your life has led you inevitably to the present moment. It’s easier to believe in a foregone conclusion than to accept that our lives are governed by chance. Showing up for a robotics course by accident, because of a classroom mixup, is chance. Finding an empty seat beside a boy with very dark skin and beautiful hands is chance. When someone has become essential to you, you will marvel that you could have lain on a warm dock and not have known him yet. Our counsellors are available around the clock for the first two weeks of your reimmersion and during business hours thereafter. We ask that you allow our Therapeutic Agents, rather than those in the general population, to address your needs. Staring with yearning ferocity from the end of a dock cannot propel you across a blue-black sea. When your body has been granted exceptional powers, it is jarring to encounter a gulf between your desires and your abilities. For millennia, engineers have empowered human beings to accomplish mythical feats. Children raised among wild animals learn to detect irregular movements in their landscape. That particular awareness, coupled with scientific genius, has made your husband a national-security hero. Intimacy with another human can allow you to scrutinize your surroundings as he would. Along a rocky, moonlit shore, the irregular movement is the one that is lurching in time with the water beneath an overhang of brush. A speedboat has most likely been hidden by your new host as a means of emergency escape. Slither between branches and board the boat; untie it and lower its motor into the water. Be grateful for the lakes in upstate New York where you learned to pilot motorboats. A smile is like a shield; it freezes your face into a mask of muscle that you can hide behind. Turn the key and gun the motor once before aiming into the blue-black sea and jamming the accelerator. The exultation of escape will be followed almost immediately by a crushing onslaught of pain. The house, its occupants, even the gunshots will seem like phantoms beside this clanging immediacy. While navigating toward a Hotspot, indicate an emergency by pressing the button behind your knee for sixty continuous seconds. If it helps, imagine yourself in your apartment, where his grandfather’s hunting knife is displayed inside a Plexiglas box. If it helps, imagine harvesting the small tomatoes you grow on your fire escape in summer. If it helps, imagine that the contents of the Data Surge will help thwart an attack in which thousands of American lives would have been lost. Remember that, should you die, your body will yield a crucial trove of information. Remember that, should you die, your Field Instructions will provide a record of your mission and lessons for those who follow. Remember that, should you die, you will have triumphed merely by delivering your physical person into our hands. You’ll understand that she concealed your paternity out of faith that her own inexhaustible love would be enough. The wish to tell your mother that you forgive her is yet another reason you must make it home alive. We can only reassure you that we have never yet failed to recover a citizen agent, dead or alive, who managed to reach a Hotspot. Looking up at the sky from below can feel like floating, suspended, and looking down. Only when you notice a woman like yourself, crumpled and bleeding at the bottom of a boat, will you realize what has happened. Released from pain, you can enact the fantasy of flying that you nurtured as a child. Keep your body in view at all times; if your mind loses track of your body, it may be hard—even impossible—to reunite the two. As you waft free in the night sky, you may notice a steady rhythmic churning in the gusting wind. A helicopter without lights is like a mixture of bat, bird, and monstrous insect. Know that in returning to your body you are consenting to be racked, once again, by physical pain. Know that in returning to your body you are consenting to undertake a jarring reimmersion into an altered life. They have left their bodies behind, and now they shimmer sublimely in the heavens. In the new heroism, the goal is to transcend individual life, with its petty pains and loves, in favor of the dazzling collective. You may picture the pulsing stars as the heroic spirits of former agent beauties. If you wish to return to your body, it is essential that you reach it before the helicopter does. By five, you should be close enough to see the bloody dress wrapped around your shoulder. By three, you should be close enough to see the dimples you were praised for as a child. You won’t know for sure until you see them crouching above you, their faces taut with hope, ready to jump. ♦ Get book recommendations, fiction, poetry, and dispatches from the world of literature in your in-box.

A Food and Drug Administration panel is set to review the safety and effectiveness of a peanut allergy treatment and recommend whether the agency should approve the drug. (Mypurgatoryyears/(iStock)) Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted Friday to recommend approval of a first-of-its-kind peanut allergy treatment, which can  . If the agency follows through and approves the drug, it would be the first of what’s expected to be a wave of new food allergy treatments that prevent a reaction, rather than simply treat one after the fact. The advisory committee voted 7 to 2 that the drug, called Palforzia, works and 8 to 1 that it is safe. The deliberations are not binding, but the agency usually follows the recommendations of advisory committees. The drug would be required to carry a black box warning, the agency’s most serious red flag that a drug can be a hazard to patients and would also be subject to an additional safety program. That’s because Palforzia carries a risk of side effects, including an increase in allergic reactions and the need for injections of After a year of treatment with Palforzia, most children in a large trial were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts. The therapy is not a cure; people will still need to avoid peanuts and carry emergency medication. Palforzia, which is made by biotech company Aimmune Therapeutics, is aimed at reducing reactions when people are inadvertently exposed to peanuts, for example when eating a food that has been cross-contaminated. The company is seeking approval for administering the drug to children ages 4 to 17. “For a family with high anxiety and a significant burden of anxiety and fear from living with [a] peanut allergy, this might give that extra buffer of safety,” said Marcus Shaker, a pediatric allergist at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine, who was not involved with the trial. “They’re still going to need to strictly avoid peanuts, but [this will help] to let go of some of the fear they may have.” The agency’s decision will be closely watched, not only because it represents the first treatment for peanut allergy but also because the therapy — essentially a capsule of pharmaceutical-grade peanut protein — is expected to be the first in a new generation of food allergy therapies that work by gradually increasing people’s exposure to the allergen. Despite the excitement, allergists said the treatment may not be appropriate for some patients. Treatment requires repeated office visits and regularly taking a drug that can trigger, in the short term, the very side effects it aims to prevent. In a large trial of 551 people, including 496 children, one in 10 of the people who received the drug dropped out because of adverse events, which included abdominal pain, vomiting and systemic allergic reactions. In that trial, 14 percent of patients taking the drug had to use an epinephrine pen to quell a severe reaction — more than twice the rate of those taking a placebo. “I think it may not be for every patient with [a] peanut allergy,” said Hemant Sharma, chief of the division of allergy and immunology at Children’s National Medical Center, who was involved in the trial. “What I will be doing, and many of us as allergists will be doing, is having careful conversations with our patients about whether this is something they’re even interested in doing.” Shaker said that it remains to be seen whether patients will accept the increased allergic reactions for the protection it confers against accidental exposure. “I think we need more data on what it’s going to mean to patients and how it’s going to change their level of risk perception and change their quality of life,” Shaker said. He said the drug is “a little bittersweet for everybody. Everyone’s happy to see something happening, and yet it’s not what we asked for from Santa Claus.” Some physicians already use escalating doses of inexpensive peanut flour to desensitize allergies, but federal approval of a drug would probably be covered by insurance and expand use of the approach. Aimmune scientists say that an approved drug will also eliminate uncertainties about dosing when using off-the-shelf peanut flour. Steve Tilles, senior director of medical affairs at Aimmune, said that it is not yet known how long people will need to stay on the drug, but he is hopeful that after a few years of treatment, people could discontinue it while remaining desensitized to peanuts. Aimmune is also working on a therapy for egg allergies and tree nuts. Other researchers are working on a skin  Aimmune did not provide information on how much the drug would cost, but a recent analysis by  , a watchdog organization that focuses on drug pricing, concluded there was insufficient evidence that the drug was more beneficial than simply avoiding peanuts.

  Vocal fold wound healing: a review for clinicians


    
  
 
      
      The basic science of wound healing is largely omitted from the curriculum of many voice clinicians. This fact is relatively disheartening as most therapeutic manipulation in the realm of laryngology and voice disorders deals with injured tissue. Therefore, the selection of therapeutic tasks for persons with vocal injury should ideally be informed by basic science in wound healing. Recently, several investigators have initiated lines of research to determine the course of vocal fold wound healing and the potential role of therapeutic agents, including behavioral agents. The current review seeks to provide a foundation of basic wound healing science and present the most current data regarding the wound healing process in the vocal folds.

since we began producing electric coils over 40 years ago. Round, rectangular, D-shaped, flat wire or custom shaped coils can be produced using precision layering practices. Single layer, multilayer, wet wound, dry wound, bifilar, multi-filar, dual, and quad coil configurations are available. Custom manufacturing solutions can be designed for a range of sizes and coil configurations. Copper, aluminum or CCA wire from #16 AWG to #48 AWG can be used to create voice coils with inner diameters ranging from 0.232”-10.0”. Custom inner diameters can be fabricated with custom tooling if required. Tolerances as tight as ±0.001” can be held on inner diameter dimensions. Coils are wound using our proprietary high-temperature adhesive capable of withstanding operating temperatures upwards of 500°F. This attribute has led customers to turn to us when competitors’ coils have come apart due to adhesive failure. Precision layering techniques and flat winding capabilities allow us to produce coils with the highest possible turn density, providing superior performance and sound characteristics. Winding with flat wire, since we do the flattening in-house, allows us to custom fit a customers’ electrical specifications (DCR, turns) into their physical specifications (ID, OD, winding width) for a much more efficient use of space. Electrical testing including resistance, inductance, and turns count testing can be performed to customer specifications. Standard lead time on voice coils is 3 weeks with additional time for new tooling if applicable. We accept blanket orders and can stock items for customers as part of our commitment to provide the highest quality service available.

  Disconnection: the user voice within the wound dressing supply chain


    
  
 
      
      This study examined the user voice in England's National Health Service (NHS) wound dressing supply chain.
     
      
      The impetus for this work came from involvement in a collaboration between industry and clinicians, entitled Woundcare Research for Appropriate Products. Experiences from that study highlighted the notable absence of research about the impact of the supply chain on the users of dressings.
     
      
      Interview data are presented following an outline of the grounded theory method used. These data were obtained from key stakeholders (n = 41) within the wound dressing supply chain such as nurses, manufacturers, distributors, professional organizations, government organizations and user groups.
     
      
      The consequences of supply disconnection revealed haphazard supply, unmet user needs and lack of information transfer between player groups.
     
      
      These consequences explain the lack of user voice in the supply chain and have far-reaching implications for nursing management, through purchasing decisions and nurses' management of wound care.

Our current healthcare system is not sustainable. As today’s clinical environment becomes more complex, there are more challenges for everyone involved in the delivery of care. New ideas, approaches, and systems are essential. Healthcare professionals from all disciplines are needed to serve in expanded leadership roles if we are to successfully transform the future of the industry. For nurses in particular, there has never been a more important time to accelerate and elevate the role they play in improving our country’s healthcare system. Nurses can contribute in new ways in leadership positions in health systems, medical centers, and in the boardroom to ensure that the nursing perspective is heard and acted upon. Research has shown that nurse leaders can have an extraordinary impact in evolving the future models of healthcare to improve outcomes and quality of life. In the landmark Institute of Medicine (IOM) report “The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health”  one of the four key messages states that nurses should be full partners with physicians and other healthcare professionals in redesigning healthcare in the United States.  This directive calls for nurses to exercise their individual and collaborative leadership voices. Advancing significant and sustainable change in healthcare is both a privilege and a responsibility, and there are opportunities for leadership in every nursing role.  Have you found yourself thinking that there must be a better way of doing things? Do you act on these instincts by seeking opportunities to lead change? It may sound surprising, but most ideas that are halted do not face resistance due to lack of support or resources, but due to lack of confidence, fear of failure, or a perceived lack of resources.  Several key characteristics of leading successfully amid complexity include extending trust, empowering and encouraging others, innovating, and connecting for impact. Many of these skills come through education and experience and/or innately for nurses.  In fact, nursing is consistently rated the “most trusted” profession.   This correlates to fertile ground for nurses to empower others, collaborate, and try new approaches in healthcare delivery in communities across our nation. Wound care nurses play a vital role in the healing process in assessing, treating, and creating care plans for patients living with complex wounds, ostomies, and related conditions. The skills and compassion demonstrated every day by these professionals translates well into significant and expanded leadership roles. The Nurses on Boards Coalition (NOBC) was launched in November 2014 as a direct response to the IOM report, which calls for nurses to play a more pivotal decision-making role on boards and commissions. The effort was initially supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the AARP as part of a collaborative effort to implement the recommendations of the IOM report through the Future of Nursing: Campaign for Action.  NOBC represents national nursing and other organizations working to build healthier communities in the U.S. by increasing the presence of nurses on corporate, health-related, and other boards, panels, and commissions. NOBC’s mission is to improve health in communities across the nation through the service of nurses on such boards. A key strategy is to ensure that 10,000 nurses serve on boards by 2020. All boards can benefit from the nursing perspective. The nursing profession has evolved to include a diverse group of professionals who are dedicated to serving patients, families, and communities, and is ideally suited to bring unique perspectives to the boardroom. Nurses possess a range of skills, including strategic planning, critical thinking, communications, quality and process improvement, communications, human resources, finance, and complex problem-solving. Accustomed to working in teams, nurses fit seamlessly into the boardroom environment with an understanding of challenges, opportunities, and implications of decisions on many levels. Wound care nurses should be asking themselves if they are interested in changing healthcare legislation, and/or serving on a hospital, public/private company, government commission, or foundation/nonprofit board. The first step for those who are interested is to express that interest, including registering in the NOBC database. When considering a board, be sure to select one that aligns with your passion for the mission of the organization. Don’t wait for an opportunity; take the initiative to contact an organization whose mission you are passionate about and ask to be kept in mind for a board seat. Many organizations are looking for diverse candidates and will likely appreciate any interested individuals (and strongly consider them as candidates).  A noteworthy reference guide, Nurse on Board: Planning Your Path to the Boardroom,  by the late Connie Curran, RN, a pioneer and role model in advancing nurse leaders to the boardroom, is suggested reading.  Connie’s goal was to articulate a clear path for nurses to become board members, and this how-to book offers practical advice and inspiring examples. We all make choices each day to act (or pass on acting) on leadership opportunities. I encourage you to release your own personal leadership voice in new ways that are meaningful to you. Decide where you want to have an impact and make a commitment to do so. Write down your goals, create an action plan, and set a timetable.  Share your goals with others and enlist their support. Consider who you might collaborate with to advance your shared goals. Lastly, make sure you celebrate your progress and success along the way! Whichever path you choose, I am confident that, individually and collectively, the nursing profession will play a significant and impactful role in redefining healthcare and improving health in communities across the nation.

By applying an  ), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much current through the coil can cause it to overheat (see  , provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed   which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its normal limits, causing distortion and possibly mechanical damage.
  is related to the heat resistance of the wire insulation, adhesive, and bobbin material, and may be influenced by the coil's position within the magnetic gap. The majority of loudspeakers use 'overhung' voice coils, with windings that are taller than the height of the magnetic gap. In this topology, a portion of the coil remains within the gap at all times. The power handling is limited by the amount of heat that can be tolerated, and the amount that can be removed from the voice coil. Some magnet designs include aluminium heat-sink rings above and below the magnet gap, to improve conduction cooling, significantly improving power handling. If  , the area of the voice coil windings is proportional to the power handling of the coil. Thus a 100 mm diameter voice coil, with a 12 mm winding height has similar power handling to a 50 mm diameter voice coil with a 24 mm winding height.
 In 'underhung' voice coil designs (see below), the coil is shorter than the magnetic gap, a topology that provides consistent   it may leave the gap, generating significant distortion and losing the heat-sinking benefit of the steel, heating rapidly.  
 Many hi-fi, and almost all professional low frequency loudspeakers (woofers) include vents in the magnet system to provide forced-air cooling of the voice coil. The pumping action of the cone and the dustcap draws in cool air and expels hot air. This method of cooling relies upon cone motion, so is ineffective at midrange or treble frequencies, although venting of midranges and tweeters does provide some acoustic advantages.
 In the earliest loudspeakers, voice coils were wound onto paper bobbins, which was appropriate for modest power levels. As more powerful amplifiers became available, alloy 1145 aluminium foil was widely substituted for paper bobbins, and the voice coils survived increased power. Typical modern hi-fi loudspeaker voice coils employ materials which can withstand   up to 150°C, or even 180°C. For professional loudspeakers, advanced thermoset composite materials are available to improve voice coil survival under severe simultaneous thermal (<300°C) and mechanical stresses.  
 Aluminium was widely used in the speaker industry due to its low cost, ease of bonding, and structural strength. When higher power amplifiers emerged, especially in professional sound, the limitations of aluminium were exposed. It rather efficiently but inconveniently transfers heat from the voice coil into the adhesive bonds of the loudspeaker, thermally degrading or even burning them.  Motion of the aluminium bobbin in the magnetic gap creates   within the material, which further increase the temperature, hindering long-term survival. In 1955 DuPont developed Kapton, a   plastic film which did not suffer from aluminium's deficiencies, so Kapton, and later Kaneka Apical were widely adopted for voice coils. As successful as these dark brown plastic films were for most hi-fi voice coils, they also had some less attractive properties, principally their cost, and an unfortunate tendency to soften when hot. Hisco P450, developed in 1992 to address the softening issue in professional speakers, is a thermoset composite of thin glassfibre cloth, impregnated with polyimide resin, combining the best characteristics of polyimide with the temperature resistance and stiffness of glassfibre. It withstands brutal physical stresses and operating temperatures up to 300°C, while its stiffness helps maintain the speaker's 'cold' frequency response.  
 The actual wire employed in voice coil winding is almost always copper, with an electrical insulation coating, and in some cases, an adhesive overcoat. Copper wire provides an easily manufactured, general purpose voice coil, at a reasonable cost. Where maximum sensitivity or extended high frequency response is required from a loudspeaker, aluminium wire may be substituted, to reduce the moving mass of the coil. While rather delicate in a manufacturing environment, aluminium wire has about one third of the mass of the equivalent gauge of copper wire, and has about two-thirds of the electrical conductivity. Copper-clad aluminium wire is occasionally used, allowing easier winding, along with a useful reduction in coil mass compared to copper. 
  coatings on other voice coil wire. This creates lightweight, low-inductance voice coils, ideally suited to use in small, extended range speakers. The principal power limitation on such coils is the thermal softening point of the adhesives which bond the wire to the bobbin, or the bobbin to the  Voice coils can be used for applications other than loudspeakers, where time force linearity and long strokes are needed. Some environments like vacuum or space require specific attention during conception, in order to evacuate coil losses. Several specific methods can be used to facilitate thermal drain.
 Overhung and underhung voice coils. Light grey is soft iron, dark grey is permanent magnetic material and the coil is in red. The image above shows two ways in which the voice coil is immersed in the magnetic field. The most common method is the   design where the height of the voice coil is greater than the magnetic gap's height. The   design which is used mostly in high-end speakers has the coil's height smaller than the gap's. The differences, advantages and disadvantages of both methods are listed below.
 Both topologies attempt the same goal: linear force acting on the coil, for a driver that reproduces the applied signal faithfully.
 In particular, it is commonly used to refer to the coil of wire that moves the read–write heads in a moving-head  . In this application, a very lightweight coil of wires is mounted within a strong magnetic field produced by permanent   that positions the heads: an electric control signal drives the voice coil and the resulting force quickly and accurately positions the heads.

         cartoon in a Dermatology Clinics textbook shows a Volkswagen Beetle, with the license
         plate TRAUMA that has driven through a wooden fence, leaving both a substantive hole
         in the fence and piles of broken wooden planks. The obvious priority would be to rebuild
         the fence so that it is identical to its pretrauma state. This analogy and accompanying
         graphic provide a framework for a unique perspective on wound healing. For the sake
         of simplicity, let us assume that the vocal fold is a fence, and instead of a Volkswagen
         Beetle, the trauma is surgical excision of a vocal fold lesion. Immediately following
         surgery, the human body initiates the process of rebuilding vocal fold tissue. From
         a physiological perspective, it would be ideal to regain the original architecture
         of the vocal fold to ensure minimal alteration to phonatory physiology. Unfortunately,
         beyond the 2nd trimester of gestation, wounds heal with subsequent scarring. In the
         vocal folds, this scarring can have significant deleterious effects on vocal fold
         pliability and lead to dysphonia. However, investigators have shown that wounds heal
         regeneratively (i.e., no scarring) in the fetal environment. This observation provides
         potential targets for therapies to direct wound healing toward a more favorable outcome.
         In this article, I provide a brief overview of the biochemical processes associated
         with wound healing. Subsequently, I outline the underlying rationale for tissue mobilization
         in the context of acute vocal fold injury. Branski, R. C., Perera, P., Verdolini, K., Rosen, C. A., Hebda, P. A., & Agarwal, S. Ehrlich, H. P., Desmouliere, A., Diegelmann, R. F., Cohen, I.

Open Access is an initiative that aims to make scientific research freely available to all. To date our community has made over 100 million downloads. It’s based on principles of collaboration, unobstructed discovery, and, most importantly, scientific progression. As PhD students, we found it difficult to access the research we needed, so we decided to create a new Open Access publisher that levels the playing field for scientists across the world. How? By making research easy to access, and puts the academic needs of the researchers before the business interests of publishers. We are a community of more than 103,000 authors and editors from 3,291 institutions spanning 160 countries, including Nobel Prize winners and some of the world’s most-cited researchers. Publishing on IntechOpen allows authors to earn citations and find new collaborators, meaning more people see your work not only from your own field of study, but from other related fields too.

Grief strikes each person in a different way. When we lose someone we love, that loss can hit us hard, all at once. Or it might lie in waiting until weeks or even months have passed before rearing its dark head. One of the things that might be difficult to understand is that for most people, the grief of a loss never leaves a person completely. The loss stays with most of us forever. It changes over time — it may start off as huge and overwhelming, but becomes smaller over time. Imagine your life is a box and the grief you feel is a ball inside of the box. Also inside the box is a pain button: In the beginning, when the loss is so fresh and new, the grief that many people feel is overwhelming and large. It’s so large, in fact, that every time you move the box — moving through your every day life — the grief ball can’t help but hit the pain button: The ball rattles around the box at random, hitting the pain button every time. This is how many people initially experience loss. You can’t control it and you can’t stop it. The pain just keeps coming pretty regularly, no matter what you do or how much others try and comfort you. The pain a person experiences may feel unrelenting and never-ending. You still go through life and the grief ball still rattles around inside the box. But because the ball has gotten smaller, it hits the pain button a little less often. You almost feel like you can go through most days without even having the pain button hit. But when it does hit, it can be completely random and unexpected. Like when you’re staring at the person’s name in your friend’s list, or come across their favorite video or TV show. The pain button still delivers the same amount of pain no matter how large or small the ball is. As time passes, the ball continues to shrink and with it, our grief for the loss experienced. . But over time, the ball becomes so small that it rarely hits the pain button. When it does, it is still as painful and hard to understand as it was the very first time we felt it. But the frequency of the hits has decreases significantly. This gives a person more time in-between each hit, time used to recover and feel “normal” again. Time also allows our hearts to heal and to begin to remember the person as they were in life. Grief is never experienced the same way for any two people. But it helps to know that grief impacts most of us in a way where the pain is intense at the beginning, but the frequency (if not the intensity) of the pain lessens over time. Most of us walk through life, carrying our own box with a ball of grief inside of it. Remember that the next time you see someone, as they may be struggling with their own ball in the box.

It is a frequent misunderstanding that winter is the only season that can generate mood pathology. Seasonal depression is not a black -and-white… Depression in a child can be mistaken as a kid with attitude. Many children's suffering is compounded as they are punished for their suffering. Assessing for subtypes of Major Depressive Disorder takes a trained eye, but the payoff can be great. Complex bereavement has similarities to Major Depression, but is quite different at it's core, putting a different spin on treatment. Paranoia is not simply synonymous with fear. It is a complex lens of distortion that manifests in different ways, dictating treatment approach. Sometimes, symptoms "owned" by one disorder evolve to be a separate, concurrent condition.

You're about to take over the high score on a table when ball 3 drains. It's game over... or is it?  All of my mid 90's pins have an extra ball button that will allow you to play one extra ball after ball 3 for an additional credit. Do you reach down and hit it to go for the high score and does it feel like cheating when you do? I'm asking for a friend.    if you use the extra ball button you can’t get your name in the official high scores list. So press away!
 I normally disable them.  However, occasionally for non-pin parties I sometimes flip them on for fun play.  Or if I’m about to reset a game I’ll put it on and play stupid long games for a bit. And of course, your games, your rules.  If you like it on, leave it on and push the crap out of it.  Always setup your games how you like to play them.  Never cheat yourself out of fun the way you like it.
 A lot of games have separate score tables for buy ins. You dont make the true top  high score
 Depends. . . if the person before you used it to get the high score, then I'd say push on!  All the games I’ve had use a different list for buy in high scores. I disable it because I don’t like to see it at the end of every game. I have them disabled on all my games that have them. But, it's your game if you like the buy in EB keep it.
 The only reason I turn this off on my games is so someone doesn’t accidentally press it during league or a tournament. Same with the quick restart option so games aren’t accidentally restarted.
 I leave mine off in settings but have it wired to administer a shock that would drop a full grown Hereford to punish would be cheaters.  It's a popular mod.  I sell it on marketplace.
 I don't use it, but I don't consider it cheating since there's a separate high score table for buy-in games.
 With a separate high score board I consider it "less cheating" than changing replays to extra balls. I keep it active but rarely use it. Most games with it have seperate high scores, and it's good for friends to be able to use it. 
Every single buy-in button on a machine I have seen active in an arcade setting. I have never seen a replay award an EB. It’s just a really dumb feature. The first thing I do upon getting one of those games is disable it.  It’s as dumb as setting games for 5 balls...doing three replay levels that all give out EBs etc...
 Slightly off topic, but is it cheating if you use glare guards bent plastic  and or invisiglass on your pins?
 Play how you want to play it.  Some of us arent good enough to see all the features in a game, so adding an extra ball as a score award is fine. I dont do 5-ball games myself, but I don't care if others do. Like mentioned, there's a separate "buy-in" high score list so you won't see it as a "true" grand champ score.  As long as you're having fun, set it up however you like. With a separate high score board I consider it "less cheating" than changing replays to extra balls. Right. Sttng has a separate board.. it was great for guests because the scores were as low as they could go so lots of people at any skill level were able to enter initials
 Side thought: I kinda wish that if you turn the extra ball buy-in feature off, it would also no longer show the buy-in high scores in attract mode.

With a separate high score board I consider it "less cheating" than changing replays to extra balls. Back in the day this was simply a way of possibly tempting someone to throw in an extra quarter or two to simply progress further into the game. This was a calculated plan to increase their bottom line. A machine on location w/ this feature would earn an additional 11% or so. Just a simple & effective gimmick to keep the funds flowing into the pinball industry back then. I disable that feature because I don't wanna be prompted at the end of a game asking if I want to continue. I never noticed games having a different high score table for that feature, so that's cool. Maybe I'll explore that feature a little now.

I personally disable it, but if it gets you to enjoy the game more, who cares what anyone else thinks?  There was recently a big   update.  I think the thing that had the most impact was changing factory default difficulty.  I'm pretty sure I could have changed the settings to make it the same or similar before the update but would never consider it.  With the new update I can complete the game, and I find it more enjoyable.  Why do I have to wait for Stern to tell me what settings are ok to use?  It makes no sense. All those settings are in there for a reason.  I will probably stay stubborn and not mess with the factory default....  unless ball save is off by default.
 If the game enables you to do it, it’s not cheating. But of course it’s not allowed In Competitive play. Buy in games are their own thing, so you can’t compare scores without buy in vs with buy in. I usually disable EBs and buy ins on my games because I think having a limit of 3 balls makes me a better player. But if it’s your game in your basement? Have fun with it.
  A machine on location w/ this feature would earn an additional 11% or so. Just a simple &amp; effective gimmick to keep the funds flowing into the pinball industry back then. Most people on here have actually said it hurt business; the player becoming board or getting too far and then not playing anymore. 
Always been interested in whether it were true...I always believed it since they never brought it back.

Since all the oxygen required either for the bacterial activities of the soil or for the root aeration of growing crops must first pass into the dissolved state, the supply of this essential element in a form immediately available must exercise a proportionately beneficial effect on the manufacture of plant food or on the growing crop. Recent work on the decomposition of organic matter in the soil has shown that rainfall is one of the chief factors controlling bacterial activity, but that its influence is due to something more than the supply of water. The oxygen dissolved in the rain appears to be the missing factor. As very little systematic work seems to have been done in this direction, estimations of dissolved oxygen in rain at Rothamsted were made from time to time during the year 1915.

 Oxygen is one of the most significant keys to deciphering past climates. Oxygen comes in heavy and light varieties, or isotopes, which are useful for paleoclimate research. Like all elements, oxygen is made up of a nucleus of protons and neutrons, surrounded by a cloud of electrons. All oxygen atoms have 8 protons, but the nucleus might contain 8, 9, or 10 neutrons. “Light” oxygen-16, with 8 protons and 8 neutrons, is the most common isotope found in nature, followed by much lesser amounts of “heavy” oxygen-18, with 8 protons and 10 neutrons. The ratio (relative amount) of these two types of oxygen in water changes with the climate. By determining how the ratio of heavy and light oxygen in marine sediments, ice cores, or fossils is different from a universally accepted standard, scientists can learn something about climate changes that have occurred in the past. The standard scientists use for comparison is based on the ratio of oxygen isotopes in ocean water at a depth of 200-500 meters.  Evaporation and condensation are the two processes that most influence the ratio of heavy oxygen to light oxygen in the oceans. Water molecules are made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Water molecules containing light oxygen evaporate slightly more readily than water molecules containing a heavy oxygen atom. At the same time, water vapor molecules containing the heavy variety of oxygen condense more readily. The Oxygen-18 isotope has an extra two neutrons, for a total of 10 neutrons and 8 protons, compared to the 8 neutrons and 8 protons in a normal oxygen atom. The slighty greater mass of  O—results in differentiation of the isotopes in the Earth’s atmosphere and hydrosphere. Scientists measure differences in oxygen isotope concentrations to reveal past climates.  [Roll mouse over nuclei to animate.] (Illustration by Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC) As air cools by rising into the atmosphere or moving toward the poles, moisture begins to condense and fall as precipitation. At first, the rain contains a higher ratio of water made of heavy oxygen, since those molecules condense more easily than water vapor containing light oxygen. The remaining moisture in the air becomes depleted of heavy oxygen as the air continues to move poleward into colder regions. As the moisture reaches the upper latitudes, the falling rain or snow is made up of more and more water molecules containing light oxygen.  During ice ages, cooler temperatures extend toward the equator, so the water vapor containing heavy oxygen rains out of the atmosphere at even lower latitudes than it does under milder conditions.  The water vapor containing light oxygen moves toward the poles, eventually condenses, and falls onto the ice sheets where it stays. The water remaining in the ocean develops increasingly higher concentration of heavy oxygen compared to the universal standard, and the ice develops a higher concentration of light oxygen. Thus, high concentrations of heavy oxygen in the ocean tell scientists that light oxygen was trapped in the ice sheets. The exact oxygen ratios can show how much ice covered the Earth.  Conversely, as temperatures rise, ice sheets melt, and freshwater runs into the ocean. Melting returns light oxygen to the water, and reduces the salinity of the oceans worldwide. Higher-than-standard global concentrations of light oxygen in ocean water  indicate that global temperatures have warmed, resulting in less global ice cover and less saline waters. Because water vapor containing heavy oxygen condenses and falls as rain before water vapor containing light oxygen, higher-than-standard local concentrations of light oxygen indicate that the watersheds draining into the sea in that region experienced heavy rains, producing more diluted waters. Thus, scientists associate lower levels of heavy oxygen (again, compared to the standard) with fresher water, which on a global scale indicates warmer temperatures and melting, and on a local scale indicates heavier rainfall. O in precipitation decreases with temperature. This graph shows the difference in  O concentration in annual precipitation compared to the average annual temperature at each site. The coldest sites, in locations such as Antartica and Greenland, have about 5 percent less  Paleoclimatologists use oxygen ratios from water trapped in glaciers as well as the oxygen absorbed in the shells of marine plants and animals to measure past temperatures and rainfall. In polar ice cores, the measurement is relatively simple: less heavy oxygen in the frozen water means that temperatures were cooler. Oxygen isotopes in ice cores taken from mountain tops closer to the equator are more difficult to measure since heavy oxygen tends to fall near the equator regardless of temperature. In shells, the measurement is far more complicated because the biological and chemical processes that form the shells skew the oxygen ratio in different ways depending on temperature. The shells of tiny plants and animals and corals are typically made of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is the same as limestone, or chalk, or silicon dioxide (SiO2), similar to the compound common in quartz sand. As the shells form, they tend to incorporate more heavy oxygen than light oxygen, regardless of the oxygen ratio in the water. The biological and chemical processes that cause the shells to incorporate greater proportions of heavy oxygen become even more pronounced as the temperature drops, so that shells formed in cold waters have an even larger proportion of heavy oxygen than shells formed in warmer waters, where the difference is less notable. This temperature-based skew effect means that the oxygen isotope make-up of shells would not precisely match the make-up of the ocean water in which they grew. Scientists must correct for this skew if they are to learn about the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the ocean waters where the shells formed. O as it travels from the equator to the poles. Because water molecules with heavy  O isotopes in them condense more easily than normal water molecules, air becomes progressively depleted in  O as it travels to high latitudes and becomes colder and drier. In turn, the snow that forms most glacial ice is also depleted in  O-rich fresh water to the ocean. Therefore, oxygen isotopes preserved in ocean sediments provide evidence for past ice ages and records of salinity. (Illustration by Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC)  Scientists can correct for the temperature factor by looking at other chemicals in the shells. In coral, for example, the balance between strontium and calcium is determined by temperature. By measuring the amounts of these chemicals in the coral, scientists can determine the ocean’s temperature, then calculate how much more heavy oxygen the shells were likely to incorporate at that temperature. Discrepancies in the oxygen isotope ratio after the temperature correction reveal changes in the ocean’s local salinity, which is related to evaporation, rainfall and runoff, and global salinity—a measure of the total amount of ice in the world. The oxygen isotope ratio has the potential to tell scientists about past climate anywhere that the ratio is preserved in water chemistry or elsewhere. Scientists are moving forward to apply this powerful tool to more and more branches of paleoclimatology. Corals with annual growth rings are extraordinarily useful to paleoclimatologists because they combine an oxygen-isotope record with precise dating. This x-ray of a coral core shows the change in  O concentration corresponding to the coral’s growth. Because living organisms interact with their environment in complex ways, isotope measurements made from coral and other fossils must be carefully calibrated.

Researchers have teased out the aromas associated with a rainstorm and deciphered the olfactory messages they convey 
When people say they can smell a storm coming, they're right. Weather patterns produce distinctive odors that sensitive noses sniff out. This year's peculiar weather patterns—such as drought in the Midwest and a "  earlier this summer—are no exception. In fact, as the rains return after a dryspell, many of these odors are stronger than ever. So, what are the scents of a summer storm? Here's a breakdown of three common odors: 
Before the rain begins, one of the first odors you may notice as winds pick up and clouds roll in is a sweet, pungent zing in your nostrils. That's the sharp, fresh aroma of ozone—a form of oxygen whose name comes from the Greek word   at the National Center for Atmospheric Research explains that ozone emanates from fertilizers and pollutants as well as natural sources. An electrical charge—from lightning or a man-made source such as an electrical generator—splits atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen molecules into separate atoms. Some of these recombine into nitric oxide, and this in turn reacts with other atmospheric chemicals, occasionally producing a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms—ozone, or O3. (Most atmospheric oxygen is made up of two atoms—O2.) The scent of ozone heralds stormy weather because a thunderstorm's downdrafts carry O3 from higher altitudes to nose level. 
Once the rains arrive, other odors come with them. Falling water disturbs and displaces odoriferous molecules on surfaces, particularly on dry ones, and carry them into the air. If you happen to be near vegetation, these molecules may come from plants and trees. For city dwellers, these odorants rise up from concrete and asphalt. Some are fragrant, others foul. 
There's a name popularly ascribed to this range of post-precipitation scents: petrichor. Petrichor was   by mineralogists Isabel Joy Bear and R. G. Thomas of Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. As they defined it, it occurs when airborne molecules from decomposing plant or animal matter become attached to mineral or clay surfaces. During a dry spell, these molecules chemically recombine with other elements on a rock's surface. Then when the rains came, the redolent combination of fatty acids, alcohols and hydrocarbons is released. 
After a storm has moved through, what's often left is an earthy-musty whiff of wetness. This is the aroma of geosmin, a metabolic by-product of bacteria or blue-green algae. Geosmin can be a comforting call to gardeners eager to dig in the dirt, but it's less beloved when it contaminates wine or drinking water, leaving a damp stench. 
All these chemicals stirred up by the weather can carry messages. Some biologists suspect that petrichor running into waterways acts as a cue to freshwater fish, signaling spawning time. Microbiologist   at the John Innes Center in England has proposed that geosmin's fragrance may be a beacon, helping camels find their way to desert oases. In return, the bacteria that produce geosmin use the camels as carriers for their spores.  at the University of Queensland has studied the traditions of aboriginal people in Australia's Western Desert. There, the first rains before wet wintry and summer months are an important event, mingling the sweet odors of damp gum leaf oils, eucalyptus, animal waste and dust. The rains bring game such as kangaroo and emu, quench thirst and transform the red desert into a verdant landscape. Young says that to these people the smell of rain is linked to the color green, a connection she calls "cultural synesthesia." In fact, many of these Aboriginal peoples manufacture their own perfume with plant and animal fats and rub it onto their bodies, a symbolic connection of body and landscape. The odor is believed to be protective and cleansing, linking present generations to their ancestors. , a member of the Monell Chemical Senses Center observes that, although humans don't appear to have innate responses to these odors, we do learn to associate them with our experiences. Flooding may forever scar us with moist, mildewy memories, but for many the smell of rain is cleansing and refreshing—relief from the relentless summer heat.

                                         This project should be supervised by a qualified scientist because corrosive chemicals will be handled in this experiment. The project requires the use of dilute nitric acid and dissolved oxygen probes. Venire and Pasco can be purchased online through their catalogs. Alternative dissolved oxygen sensors can be purchased from local pet stores that specialize in the sale of fish. Nitric acid can be located in the chemical store room of most laboratories. This project investigates the relationship between acid rain and the dissolved oxygen concentration of water. The goals of the project include simulating the environment of a pond by filling a fish tank with water and planting some underwater plants such as alfalfa inside the tank. Acid rain across the country is responsible for weathering of rocks, statues, and facades of buildings. Since the early 1980s, scientists have initiated lengthy investigations to understand the cause and affects of acid rain. Acid rain is caused by the release of nitric oxides and sulfur oxides into the atmosphere as exhaust fumes from automobiles and the burning of rubber in factories releases these substances in to the air. Nitric oxides and sulfur oxides dissolve in water to form weak acids and precipitate to form weak acids and precipitate as acid rain. The slightly acidic rain depletes nutrients from soil and is responsible for the death of fish. This investigation explores the correlation between acid rain and dissolved oxygen concentration in a pond to determine if a relationship exists between the two. If acid rain directly affects dissolved oxygen concentration, life dependent on oxygen in a pond will be negatively affected by acid rain and solutions/methods to replace the oxygen in ponds affected by acid rains could be put in place to reduce the impact of acid rain.

  The abatement of acid rain in Guizhou province, southwestern China: Implication from sulfur and oxygen isotopes


    
  
 
      
      The high frequency of acid rain in southern China has captured public and official concern since 1980s. Subsequently, gas emission reduction measures have been implemented to improve the air quality. Variations in SO  emission intensities can influence the sulfur and oxygen isotopic compositions of sulfate in rainwater, since atmospheric sulfate is mainly formed via the oxidation of sulfur gases from natural and anthropogenic sources. To evaluate the impacts of emission reduction measures on atmospheric sulfate, the seasonal and long-term trends in stable isotopic compositions of sulfate in rainwater in Guizhou province, southwestern China have been investigated based on rainwater samples collected from June 2016 to June 2018 and literature investigation (2000-2010).The results reveal that coal combustion remains a major contributor to sulfate in rainwater, although its SO  values in rainwater are negatively correlated and have significant seasonal changes. The seasonality in δ  has been interpreted as due to the changes in contributions of dimethyl sulfide and coal combustion, while the seasonal pattern of δ  values, indicating sulfate in rainwater is mainly formed by heterogeneous oxidation of SO . Combined with the data from previous studies (Xiao and Liu, 2002; Liu, 2007; Xiao et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2014), we found that the volume weighted mean δ S values of sulfate in rainwater in Guizhou province show a marked increase between 2001 and 2018, indicating that the   emission from coal combustion has declined during this period. Furthermore, the synchronous changes in δ S values, sulfate concentration and pH values of rainwater suggest that the frequency of acid rain in Guizhou province has dropped over the past two decades, which is likely to result from the emission reduction measures taken in Guizhou province.

Trees don’t just exhale oxygen—they also consume it in a process known as cellular respiration, where they convert the sugars they amass during the day into energy, using oxygen to power the process. So during the night when there’s no sun around for photosynthesis, they’re net absorbers of oxygen. Malhi’s research team reckons that trees inhale a little over half the oxygen they produce this way. The rest is probably used up by the countless microbes that live in the Amazon, which inhale oxygen to break down dead organic matter of the forest. “The net [oxygen] effect of the Amazon, or really any other biome, is around zero,” he explains. Because of this balance between oxygen production and consumption, modern ecosystems barely budge oxygen levels in the atmosphere. Instead, the oxygen we breathe is the   that have over billions of years steadily accumulated oxygen that made the atmosphere breathable, explains  This oxygen could only accumulate because the plankton became trapped at the bottom of the ocean before they could rot—otherwise, their decomposition by other microbes would have used up that oxygen. The processes that determine how much oxygen is found in the atmosphere on average occur over vast geological timescales and aren’t really influenced by the photosynthesis going on now, Denning explains in an article in  Nevertheless, the 20 percent myth has been making the rounds for decades, though it’s unclear where it originated. Malhi and Coe reckon it stems from the fact that the Amazon contributes around 20 percent of the oxygen produced by photosynthesis on land—which may have erroneously slipped into public knowledge as “20 percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere.” Obviously, none of this is to say that the Amazon isn’t important. In its pristine state, it   to pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Coe likens it not to a pair of lungs, but to a giant air conditioner that cools the planet—one of our most powerful in mitigating climate change, alongside other tropical forests in central Africa and Asia—some of which are also currently  The Amazon also plays an important role in stabilizing rainfall cycles in South America, and is a crucial home for indigenous peoples as well as countless animal and plant species. “Very few people talk about biodiversity, but the Amazon is the most biodiverse ecosystem on land, and climate change and deforestation are putting that richness at risk,” notes climate scientist  For its importance to the world, the Amazon might as well be a metaphorical pair of lungs, and this analogy may have been helpful in galvanizing action around deforestation. But to most researchers, it doesn’t make much sense—not least because actual lungs inhale oxygen rather than exhaling it. “If people want to relate it to a fundamental part of their body that maintains stability and maintains life, maintains wellbeing—symbolically, you can make some kind of association,” says Nobre. “But physically speaking, it’s not really the lungs of the world, no.”

Find more information on Atmospheric dust deposition can be a significant source of phosphorus (P) in some tropical forests, so information on the origins and solubility of atmospheric P is needed to understand and predict patterns of forest productivity under future climate scenarios. We characterized atmospheric dust P across a seasonal cycle in a tropical lowland rain forest on Barro Colorado Nature Monument (BCNM), Republic of Panama. We traced P sources by combining remote sensing imagery with the first measurements of stable oxygen isotopes in soluble inorganic phosphate (δ ) in dust. In addition, we measured soluble inorganic and organic P concentrations in fine (<1 μm) and coarse (>1 μm) aerosol fractions and used this data to estimate the contribution of P inputs from dust deposition to the forest P budget. Aerosol dry mass was greater in the dry season (December to April, 5.6−15.7 μg m ). In contrast, soluble P concentrations in the aerosols were lower in the dry season (980–1880 μg P g  of dry-season aerosols resembled that of nearby forest soils (∼19.5‰), suggesting a local origin. In the wet season, when the Trans-Atlantic Saharan dust belt moves north close to Panama, the δ  of aerosols was considerably lower (∼15.5‰), suggesting a significant contribution of long-distance dust P transport. Using satellite retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the P concentrations in aerosols we sampled in periods when Saharan dust was evident we estimate that the monthly P input from long distance dust transport during the period with highest Saharan dust deposition is 88 ± 31 g P ha , equivalent to between 10 and 29% of the P in monthly litter fall in nearby forests. These findings have important implications for our understanding of modern nutrient budgets and the productivity of tropical forests in the region under future climate scenarios.

FAIRVIEW — Congressman Frank Lucas spoke on a variety of issues Tuesday afternoon in a town hall meeting in Fairview. Lucas spoke a familiar refrain, stating the “political oxygen” is being sucked from Congress and presidential “silly season” is underway. Regarding Oklahoma, Lucas said the state needs rain. Two of the state’s biggest economic drivers —agriculture and oil— both are impacted by drought, ethanol and other factors. “We’re caught in a lack of world demand because of lagging world economies,” he said of the two topics. Agriculture will balance out, he said, but Congress will need to review some Conservation Reserve Programs next year. “This is not 1982,” he said. “It took 15 years for property prices to recover then. It won’t be 15 years. It’s just a matter of how many. I think two to three.” Regarding federal politics, appropriation bills and a budget resolution remain at a standstill, and Lucas said Congress may not pass a budget resolution. Lucas, R-Okla., said one year ago Congress passed a budget resolution that set spending caps. The resolution was amended in December and funded the federal government through September 2016, he said. “Of the $4 trillion the federal government will spend next year, about $1 trillion is discretionary money — money spent on an annual, year-to-year basis,” he said. “The other $3 trillion is mandatory money — from Medicare to Social Security to crop insurance — all of those things. So, one-fourth of total spending you have year-to-year control on. The caps agreed to a year ago are about $30 billion different than the caps agreed to last December.” Lucas said lawmakers are discussing operating by December’s agreement or the smaller caps from one year ago. “If we don’t get one (budget resolution) done, well at some point we have to do our work,” he said. Lucas also spoke on Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s death and President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland. Lucas said he does not disagree with waiting to appoint a new justice until the new president is elected. “But, if you get to a point in November where someone is elected that the majority in the Senate thinks is even more likely to appoint a judge even more extreme, don’t be surprised if the fella that President Obama has nominated — don’t be surprised if given a choice between that nominee or a Hilary Clinton or Bernie Sanders with a nominee that you don’t get this guy lined up at the last minute,” Lucas said. Lucas has not endorsed a presidential candidate, but stands by his previous statement that Sanders will not be the Democratic nominee. “We may have a Republican convention this summer where the nominee will be decided on the floor,” he said. “Up until 10 days ago, I may not have said that.” “If you were running a business, you’d ask for more resumes,” he said. “It’s like reality TV has come to the presidential campaign. Stop talking about each other's wife. Can you remember a time when there was less focus on the issues?” https://www.enidnews.com/news/local_news/lucas-oklahoma-needs-rain/article_c90f47fe-c8be-5a6b-b50f-fb49fea699a9.html

								Oxygen-18 is a heavier-than-normal isotope of oxygen. In a rain cloud, water molecules containing oxygen-18 are rarer than water molecules containing normal oxygen. But in rainfall, a higher proportion of all water molecules containing oxygen-18 than of all water molecules containing ordinary oxygen descends to earth. Consequently, scientists were surprised when measurements along the entire route of rain clouds’ passage from above the Atlantic Ocean, the site of their original formation, across the Amazon forests, where it rains almost daily, showed that the oxygen-18 content of each of the clouds remained fairly constant. Which one of the following statements, if true, best helps to resolve the conflict between scientists’ expectations, based on the known behavior of oxygen-18, and the result of their measurements of the rain clouds’ oxygen-18 content? (A) Rain clouds above tropical forests are poorer in oxygen-18 than rain clouds above unforested regions. (B) Like the oceans, tropical rain forests can create or replenish rain clouds in the atmosphere above them. (C) The amount of rainfall over the Amazon rain forests is exactly the same as the amount of rain originally collected in the clouds formed above the Atlantic Ocean. (D) The amount of rain recycled back into the atmosphere from the leaves of forest vegetation is exactly the same as the amount of rain in river runoffs that is not recycled into the atmosphere. (E) Oxygen-18 is not a good indicator of the effect of tropical rain forests on the atmosphere above them.

Brilliant question. Tricky in part but easy when you get it. Question says O2 18 is rarer in cloud ⛅️ than other isotopes of O2. Lets give them some numbers 10 and 90. When it rains say 5 O2-18 isotopes fall and 3 normal isotope falls down. But the ratio 10 and 90 is maintained through the amazon. Why?   Which one of the following statements, if true, best helps to resolve the conflict between scientists’ expectations, based on the known behavior of oxygen-18, and the result of their measurements of the rain clouds’ oxygen-18 content? This is resolve the paradox question so correct option should explain both sides of the argument.   Ans should explain why the ratio of 10 O2-18 isotope and 90 isotope is maintained? Maybe something is replenishing 5 O2 isotope and 3 other isotopes that fell during the rain. This leads us to B. Lets see other options.  (A) Rain clouds above tropical forests are poorer in oxygen-18 than rain clouds above unforested regions. - does this explains both sides of the argument? No (B) Like the oceans, tropical rain forests can create or replenish rain clouds in the atmosphere above them. - okay, if clouds can be replenished then ratio would be same and then this will explain why scientists are surprised with their results and which they thought is contrary to their expectations. B Looks great. (C) The amount of rainfall over the Amazon rain forests is exactly the same as the amount of rain originally collected in the clouds formed above the Atlantic Ocean.- then the isotope ratio should decrease and not stay constant.  (D) The amount of rain recycled back into the atmosphere from the leaves of forest vegetation is exactly the same as the amount of rain in river runoffs that is not recycled into the atmosphere.- uneventfully we can ignore this option. Does not resolve the paradox.  (E) Oxygen-18 is not a good indicator of the effect of tropical rain forests on the atmosphere above them.- i hate to use out of scope but this option indeed is out of scope, doesn’t resolve the paradox, talks of indicators of rain forest this is old link /forum/search.php?view=search_tags&amp;sid=f84a449fc1ecbf714d7e50a38ff34706 [ann]

							 AUSTIN (KXAN) — A line of moderate rain showers are moving into the western parts of the Hill Country this morning. Elsewhere, there’s light rain falling. Temperatures are around 40 degrees, but will be dropping throughout the rest of the morning to near freezing. This band of rain showers will expand in coverage and intensity as it marches towards the I-35 corridor this morning. This is right around the time we think temperatures will begin to fall to near freezing.  One of our high resolution models shows snow falling for much of the Hill Country with a thin band of a wintry mix, while the rest of the region will be seeing a cold rain by around 9am By around 2pm, frigid air will be surging south as the upper low moves across Texas. As a result, more of Central Texas could be seeing snow falling later this afternoon.  snow looks less likely the farther south and east. It’s also important to note that the forecast for snow accumulation is what you’ll likely find on grassy surfaces, vehicles, etc. and not necessarily sticking to the roads. Regardless, you will want to stay home and off the roads today. A slight drop in temperatures can quickly switch your precipitation from rain to snow, making for some slick and icy roads,  Precipitation will end from west to east this evening. Temperatures will hold steady near freezing overnight, so no matter the precipitation type you saw, it all has the potential to freeze over heading into our Monday morning commute. Drive carefully! The National Weather Service has issued a Winer Storm Warning (pink) for areas generally north of Highway 290 for 1″-3″ of accumulating snow. A Winter Weather Advisory (blue) has been issued for areas along and south of Highway 290 for up to 1″ of accumulating snow.

                 Kate Connell sweeps water and mud from the floor at Salty's Gulfport bar Thursday in Gulfport, Fla., in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Eta. After briefly picking up hurricane strength, Eta weakened into a tropical storm and hit the Gulf Coast of Florida early Thursday. Tropical Storm Eta made landfall with winds of 50 mph at 4 a.m. near Cedar Key, Fla., according to the  . The storm is cutting across Florida and is forecast to reach the Atlantic by early Thursday afternoon local time.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- New this morning: As the system looks to trend a bit farther south, several counties north of Houston have just been placed under a Winter Weather Advisory. This includes Austin, Waller, and Montgomery counties. The advisory begins today at noon and goes through 6 a.m. Monday. The National Weather Service has also issued a Winter Storm Warning for several of Houston's northern counties from noon Sunday until 6 am Monday. This includes San Jacinto, Polk, Brazos, Burleson, Grimes, Houston, Madison, Trinity, Walker, and Washington counties. The NWS says one to four inches of snow is expected in the area with locally higher amounts. These accumulations could disrupt travel. This morning we are seeing a few showers across the area. Rain becomes more widespread into the afternoon and evening Sunday. As temperatures drop, some of the rain could change to snow/wintry mix in areas north of Houston. It is certainly possible we see a few flakes, but we are looking primarily at a rain event in the Houston area, and any snow we do happen to see would melt immediately. At this time we expect a cold rain to settle in during the day with temperatures falling from the 40s into the 30s. Most of us will pick up about an inch of rain. Meanwhile north of Houston the the rain/snow line is expected to push during the afternoon, and snow could continue into the early morning hours of Monday. How far south the snow goes is still uncertain, but snowflakes could possibly reach the I-10 corridor. At this time we are giving it a 20% chance that snowflakes could reach the north side of Houston, but there's less than a 10% chance of snowflakes reaching Houston south of I-10. It's looking more likely that snowflakes will fly across parts of Brazos, Grimes, Montgomery, Polk, San Jacinto, Walker, and Washington Counties. In the counties under the Winter Storm Warning, 1-4" of snow will be common with locally higher amounts. There are still some computer models suggesting great than 6" could fall in isolated spots. Winter weather is coming, and TxDOT is taking no chances on slippery freeways this weekend. Here's what SkyEye found as crews got to work ahead of the weather event.

From the makers of wildly popluar Infinite Storm - The new Storm is the most organic relaxing way to listen to sounds of rain and storms on IOS.  Normally storm apps are based on predictable audio loops, this goes beyond that and dynamically creates the storm based on presets or you can customize the storm yourself using the intutive controls.  Storm gives you a constant storm to help you sleep, study, relax or provide you a way to hide your tinnitus and let you rest! It’s so simpler to use, you can customize the rain however you want, with different moods, rain types, etc. I use it sometimes when I’m studying or when the night/day is perfect for some rain but it’s not lol 1) When it randomizes between storm types, it fades out, pauses and fades back in. This is kind of disruptive. It would be nice if it were a quick cross-fade.  2) The mood music backing tracks are too short, repetitive and have similar fade issues as the storms.  3) There's an overall volume and rain volume, but no music volume. I'd like to leave the rain loud but turn down the music. It would also be nice to have a separate thunder volume, if possible. I would send my feedback directly to the developer, but the only channel for that is Facebook and I don't do Facebook. It'll be just about perfect if they make these changes and I'll gladly update my review. I hope they see it here! Very sweet and truly calming.

Tropical Storm Eta brings rain, flash flooding to Florida; could strengthen into hurricane "It was raining harder than any Category 4 hurricane we have had," one resident said. Tropical Storm Eta swamped huge swaths of South Florida on Monday before moving into the Gulf of Mexico, where it is expected to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane. Officials in Miami said that some areas of the city saw major flooding and downed trees, though there were no reports of injuries or deaths. More than 11,000 homes and businesses lost power, Mayor Francis Suarez said. By Monday afternoon that number had dropped to roughly 1,600, he said. , the storm had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as it moved over the Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center said the storm was 110 miles from the Western tip of Cuba. . Alex Muriel, 45, of Hialeah, north of Miami, said the storm was among the worst he'd experienced in decades. Muriel was awakened by an alert on his phone at 5 a.m. and saw the water had topped the tires of his car. "It was raining harder than any Category 4 hurricane we have had," he told NBC News.  that her family escaped their flooded home with a few belongings, but appeared to get shocked as they tried to escape. "I was scared because my kids were in the water," she told the station. "All our clothes are floating. We lost everything really." Forecasters had expected seven to 11 inches of rain around Miami and Fort Lauderdale. The most powerful winds recorded after Eta arrived at U.S. shores was a 71 mph gust at Carysfort Reef in the Florida Keys, but precipitation was worst overnight to the north and east of the storm's eye. Rain was forecast for much of the state Monday, with two to four inches predicted with some areas expecting up to 18 inches, with isolated tornadoes. Later in the week, there is more uncertainty about what track Eta will take. The current forecast meanders Eta around the Gulf through late week before potentially making a second landfall along the northern Gulf Coast of Florida late Friday into early Saturday. The storm is part of a record-shattering 2020 hurricane season. It is the 12th named storm to make landfall on the continental United States; the previous record was nine. And Eta is Florida's first November tropical storm landfall since 1998. Eta carved a deadly path across Central America after it made landfall Tuesday as a Category 4 Hurricane. Nicaragua recorded 140 mph winds and structural damage to buildings. Over 100 people are reported missing in Guatemala and 27 are confirmed dead, and local authorities in Honduras say 21 have died in that country.

Discussion with Kara Rogers of how the scientific model is used to test a hypothesis or represent a theory Kara Rogers, senior biomedical sciences editor of Encyclopædia Britannica, discussing the difference between a scientific hypothesis and a scientific theory. ,  any system of knowledge that is concerned with the physical world and its phenomena and that entails unbiased observations and systematic experimentation. In general, a science involves a pursuit of knowledge covering general truths or the operations of fundamental laws. Observing the natural world and paying attention to its patterns has been part of human history from the very beginning. However, studying nature to understand it purely for its own sake seems to have had its start among the pre-Socratic philosophers of the 6th century BCE, such as   extensively as a powerful tool in the further understanding of phenomena. Sometimes scientific discoveries have inspired mathematicians, and at other times scientists have realized that forms of mathematics that were developed without any regard for their usefulness could be applied to understanding the physical world. All peoples have studied the natural world, but most ancient peoples studied it for practical purposes, such as paying attention to natural cycles to know when to plant crops. It does not seem to have been until the 6th century BCE that the pre-Socratic philosophers (who lived in what is now Turkey and Greece) began seeking to understand nature as an end in itself.

The science of science (SciSci) is based on a transdisciplinary approach that uses large data sets to study the mechanisms underlying the doing of science—from the choice of a research problem to career trajectories and progress within a field. In a Review, Fortunato   explain that the underlying rationale is that with a deeper understanding of the precursors of impactful science, it will be possible to develop systems and policies that improve each scientist's ability to succeed and enhance the prospects of science as a whole. The increasing availability of digital data on scholarly inputs and outputs—from research funding, productivity, and collaboration to paper citations and scientist mobility—offers unprecedented opportunities to explore the structure and evolution of science. The science of science (SciSci) offers a quantitative understanding of the interactions among scientific agents across diverse geographic and temporal scales: It provides insights into the conditions underlying creativity and the genesis of scientific discovery, with the ultimate goal of developing tools and policies that have the potential to accelerate science. In the past decade, SciSci has benefited from an influx of natural, computational, and social scientists who together have developed big data–based capabilities for empirical analysis and generative modeling that capture the unfolding of science, its institutions, and its workforce. The value proposition of SciSci is that with a deeper understanding of the factors that drive successful science, we can more effectively address environmental, societal, and technological problems. Science can be described as a complex, self-organizing, and evolving network of scholars, projects, papers, and ideas. This representation has unveiled patterns characterizing the emergence of new scientific fields through the study of collaboration networks and the path of impactful discoveries through the study of citation networks. Microscopic models have traced the dynamics of citation accumulation, allowing us to predict the future impact of individual papers. SciSci has revealed choices and trade-offs that scientists face as they advance both their own careers and the scientific horizon. For example, measurements indicate that scholars are risk-averse, preferring to study topics related to their current expertise, which constrains the potential of future discoveries. Those willing to break this pattern engage in riskier careers but become more likely to make major breakthroughs. Overall, the highest-impact science is grounded in conventional combinations of prior work but features unusual combinations. Last, as the locus of research is shifting into teams, SciSci is increasingly focused on the impact of team research, finding that small teams tend to disrupt science and technology with new ideas drawing on older and less prevalent ones. In contrast, large teams tend to develop recent, popular ideas, obtaining high, but often short-lived, impact. SciSci offers a deep quantitative understanding of the relational structure between scientists, institutions, and ideas because it facilitates the identification of fundamental mechanisms responsible for scientific discovery. These interdisciplinary data-driven efforts complement contributions from related fields such as scientometrics and the economics and sociology of science. Although SciSci seeks long-standing universal laws and mechanisms that apply across various fields of science, a fundamental challenge going forward is accounting for undeniable differences in culture, habits, and preferences between different fields and countries. This variation makes some cross-domain insights difficult to appreciate and associated science policies difficult to implement. The differences among the questions, data, and skills specific to each discipline suggest that further insights can be gained from domain-specific SciSci studies, which model and identify opportunities adapted to the needs of individual research fields. Science can be seen as an expanding and evolving network of ideas, scholars, and papers. SciSci searches for universal and domain-specific laws underlying the structure and dynamics of science. Identifying fundamental drivers of science and developing predictive models to capture its evolution are instrumental for the design of policies that can improve the scientific enterprise—for example, through enhanced career paths for scientists, better performance evaluation for organizations hosting research, discovery of novel effective funding vehicles, and even identification of promising regions along the scientific frontier. The science of science uses large-scale data on the production of science to search for universal and domain-specific patterns. Here, we review recent developments in this transdisciplinary field. The deluge of digital data on scholarly output offers unprecedented opportunities to explore patterns characterizing the structure and evolution of science. The science of science (SciSci) places the practice of science itself under the microscope, leading to a quantitative understanding of the genesis of scientific discovery, creativity, and practice and developing tools and policies aimed at accelerating scientific progress. The emergence of SciSci has been driven by two key factors. The first is data availability. In addition to the proprietary Web of Science (WoS), the historic first citation index ( ), multiple data sources are available today (Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and others). Some of these sources are freely accessible, covering millions of data points pertaining to scientists and their output and capturing research from all over the world and all branches of science. Second, SciSci has benefited from an influx of and collaborations among natural, computational, and social scientists who have developed big data–based capabilities and enabled critical tests of generative models that aim to capture the unfolding of science, its institutions, and its workforce. One distinctive characteristic of this emerging field is how it breaks down disciplinary boundaries. SciSci integrates findings and theories from multiple disciplines and uses a wide range of data and methods. From scientometrics, it takes the idea of measuring science from large-scale data sources; from the sociology of science, it adopts theoretical concepts and social processes; and from innovation studies, it explores and identifies pathways through which science contributes to invention and economic change. SciSci relies on a broad collection of quantitative methods, from descriptive statistics and data visualization to advanced econometric methods, network science approaches, machine-learning algorithms, mathematical analysis, and computer simulation, including agent-based modeling. The value proposition of SciSci hinges on the hypothesis that with a deeper understanding of the factors behind successful science, we can enhance the prospects of science as a whole to more effectively address societal problems. Contemporary science is a dynamical system of undertakings driven by complex interactions among social structures, knowledge representations, and the natural world. Scientific knowledge is constituted by concepts and relations embodied in research papers, books, patents, software, and other scholarly artifacts, organized into scientific disciplines and broader fields. These social, conceptual, and material elements are connected through formal and informal flows of information, ideas, research practices, tools, and samples. Science can thus be described as a complex, self-organizing, and constantly evolving multiscale network. Early studies discovered an exponential growth in the volume of scientific literature ( ). Yet, it would be naïve to equate the growth of the scientific literature with the growth of scientific ideas. Changes in the publishing world, both technological and economic, have led to increasing efficiency in the production of publications. Moreover, new publications in science tend to cluster in discrete areas of knowledge ( ). Large-scale text analysis, using phrases extracted from titles and abstracts to measure the cognitive extent of the scientific literature, have found that the conceptual territory of science expands linearly with time. In other words, whereas the number of publications grows exponentially, the space of ideas expands only linearly ( ) Growth of ideas covered by articles indexed in the WoS. This was determined by counting unique title phrases (concepts) in a fixed number of articles ( Frequently occurring words and phrases in article titles and abstracts propagate via citation networks, punctuated by bursts corresponding to the emergence of new paradigms ( ). By applying network science methods to citation networks, researchers are able to identify communities as defined by subsets of publications that frequently cite one another ( ). These communities often correspond to groups of authors holding a common position regarding specific issues ( ). Recent work focusing on biomedical science has illustrated how the growth of the literature reinforces these communities ( ). As new papers are published, associations (hyperedges) between scientists, chemicals, diseases, and methods (“things,” which are the nodes of the network) are added. Most new links fall between things only one or two steps away from each other, implying that when scientists choose new topics, they prefer things directly related to their current expertise or that of their collaborators. This densification suggests that the existing structure of science may constrain what will be studied in the future. Densification at the boundaries of science is also a signal of transdisciplinary exploration, fusion, and innovation. A life-cycle analysis of eight fields ( ) shows that successful fields undergo a process of knowledge and social unification that leads to a giant connected component in the collaboration network ( ), corresponding to a sizeable group of regular coauthors. A model in which scientists choose their collaborators through random walks on the coauthorship network successfully reproduces author productivity, the number of authors per discipline, and the interdisciplinarity of papers and authors ( How do scientists decide which research problems to work on? Sociologists of science have long hypothesized that these choices are shaped by an ongoing tension between productive tradition and risky innovation ( ). Scientists who adhere to a research tradition in their domain often appear productive by publishing a steady stream of contributions that advance a focused research agenda. But a focused agenda may limit a researcher’s ability to sense and seize opportunities for staking out new ideas that are required to grow the field’s knowledge. For example, a case study focusing on biomedical scientists choosing novel chemicals and chemical relationships shows that as fields mature, researchers tend to focus increasingly on established knowledge ( ). Although an innovative publication tends to result in higher impact than a conservative one, high-risk innovation strategies are rare, because the additional reward does not compensate for the risk of failure to publish at all. Scientific awards and accolades appear to function as primary incentives to resist conservative tendencies and encourage betting on exploration and surprise ( ). Despite the many factors shaping what scientists work on next, macroscopic patterns that govern changes in research interests along scientific careers are highly reproducible, documenting a high degree of regularity underlying scientific research and individual careers ( Scientists’ choice of research problems affects primarily their individual careers and the careers of those reliant on them. Scientists’ collective choices, however, determine the direction of scientific discovery more broadly ( ) serve individual careers well but are less effective for science as a whole. Such strategies are amplified by the file drawer problem ( ): Negative results, at odds with established hypotheses, are rarely published, leading to a systemic bias in published research and the canonization of weak and sometimes false facts ( ). More risky hypotheses may have been tested by generations of scientists, but only those successful enough to result in publications are known to us. One way to alleviate this conservative trap is to urge funding agencies to proactively sponsor risky projects that test truly unexplored hypotheses and take on special interest groups advocating for particular diseases. Measurements show that the allocation of biomedical resources in the United States is more strongly correlated to previous allocations and research than to the actual burden of diseases ( ), highlighting a systemic misalignment between biomedical needs and resources. This misalignment casts doubts on the degree to which funding agencies, often run by scientists embedded in established paradigms, are likely to influence the evolution of science without introducing additional oversight, incentives, and feedback. ) The average efficiency rate for global strategies to discover new, publishable chemical relationships, estimated from all MEDLINE-indexed articles published in 2010. This model does not take into account differences in the difficulty or expense of particular experiments. The efficiency of a global scientific strategy is expressed by the average number of experiments performed (vertical axis) relative to the number of new, published biochemical relationships (horizontal axis), which correspond to new connections in the published network of biochemicals co-occurring in MEDLINE-indexed articles. Compared strategies include randomly choosing pairs of biochemicals, the global (“actual”) strategy inferred from all scientists publishing MEDLINE articles, and optimal strategies for discovering 50 and 100% of the network. Lower values on the vertical axis indicate more efficient strategies, showing that the actual strategy of science is suboptimal for discovering what has been published. The actual strategy is best for uncovering 13% of the chemical network, and the 50% optimal strategy is most efficient for discovering 50% of it, but neither are as good as the 100% optimal strategy for revealing the whole network. ( ) The actual, estimated search process illustrated on a hypothetical network of chemical relationships, averaged from 500 simulated runs of that strategy. The strategy swarms around a few “important,” highly connected chemicals, whereas optimal strategies are much more even and less likely to “follow the crowd” in their search across the space of scientific possibilities. [Adapted from ( Analyses of publications and patents consistently reveal that rare combinations in scientific discoveries and inventions tend to garner higher citation rates ( ); hence, the successful combination of previously disconnected ideas and resources that is fundamental to interdisciplinary research often violates expectations and leads to novel ideas with high impact ( ). Nevertheless, evidence from grant applications shows that, when faced with new ideas, expert evaluators systematically give lower scores to truly novel ( The highest-impact science is primarily grounded in conventional combinations of prior work, yet it simultaneously features unusual combinations ( ). In other words, a balanced mixture of new and established elements is the safest path toward successful reception of scientific advances. Individual academic careers unfold in the context of a vast market for knowledge production and consumption ( ). Consequently, scientific careers have been examined not only in terms of individual incentives and marginal productivity (i.e., relative gain versus effort) ( ). This requires combining large repositories of high-resolution individual, geographic, and temporal metadata ( ) to construct representations of career trajectories that can be analyzed from different perspectives. For example, one study finds that funding schemes that are tolerant of early failure, which reward long-term success, are more likely to generate high-impact publications than grants subject to short review cycles ( ). Interacting systems with competing time scales are a classic problem in complex systems science. The multifaceted nature of science is motivation for generative models that highlight unintended consequences of policies. For example, models of career growth show that nontenure (short-term) contracts are responsible for productivity fluctuations, which often result in a sudden career death ( ), and they are penalized in hiring decisions when compared with equally qualified men ( ). The causes of these gaps are still unclear. Intrinsic differences in productivity rates and career length can explain the differences in collaboration patterns ( ) between male and female scientists. On the other hand, experimental evidence shows that biases against women occur at very early career stages. When gender was randomly assigned among the curricula vitae of a pool of applicants, the hiring committee systematically penalized female candidates ( ). Most studies so far have focused on relatively small samples. Improvements in compiling large-scale data sets on scientific careers, which leverage information from different sources (e.g., publication records, grant applications, and awards), will help us gain deeper insight into the causes of inequality and motivate models that can inform policy solutions. Scientists’ mobility is another important factor offering diverse career opportunities. Most mobility studies have focused on quantifying the brain drain and gain of a country or a region ( ), especially after policy changes. Research on individual mobility and its career effect remains scant, however, primarily owing to the difficulty of obtaining longitudinal information about the movements of many scientists and accounts of the reasons underlying mobility decisions. Scientists who left their country of origin outperformed scientists who did not relocate, according to their citation scores, which may be rooted in a selection bias that offers better career opportunities to better scientists ( ). Nevertheless, when examining changes in impact associated with each move as quantified by citations, no systematic increase or decrease was found, not even when scientists moved to an institution of considerably higher or lower rank ( ). In other words, it is not the institution that creates the impact; it is the individual researchers that make an institution. Another potentially important career factor is reputation—and the dilemma that it poses for manuscript review, proposal evaluation, and promotion decisions. The reputation of paper authors, measured by the total citations of their previous output, markedly boosts the number of citations collected by that paper in the first years after publication ( ). After this initial phase, however, impact depends on the reception of the work by the scientific community. This finding, along with the work reported in ( ), suggests that, for productive scientific careers, reputation is less of a critical driver for success than talent, hard work, and relevance. A policy-relevant question is whether creativity and innovation depend on age or career stage. Decades of research on outstanding researchers and innovators concluded that major breakthroughs take place relatively early in a career, with a median age of 35 ( ). In contrast, recent work shows that this well-documented propensity of early-career discoveries is fully explained by productivity, which is high in the early stages of a scientist’s career and drops later ( ). In other words, there are no age patterns in innovation: A scholar’s most cited paper can be any of his or her papers, independently of the age or career stage when it is published ( ). A stochastic model of impact evolution also indicates that breakthroughs result from a combination of the ability of a scientist and the luck of picking a problem with high potential ( ) Publication record of three Nobel laureates in physics. The horizontal axis indicates the number of years after a laureate’s first publication, each circle corresponds to a research paper, and the height of the circle represents the paper’s impact, quantified by  , the number of citations after 10 years. The highest-impact paper of a laureate is denoted with an orange circle. ( ) Histogram of the occurrence of the highest-impact paper in a scientist’s sequence of publications, calculated for 10,000 scientists. The flatness of the histogram indicates that the highest-impact work can be, with the same probability, anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist ( During past decades, reliance on teamwork has increased, representing a fundamental shift in the way that science is done. A study of the authorship of 19.9 million research articles and 2.1 million patents reveals a nearly universal shift toward teams in all branches of science ( ). For example, in 1955, science and engineering teams authored about the same number of papers as single authors. Yet by 2013, the fraction of team-authored papers increased to 90% ( Mean team size has been steadily growing over the past century. The red dashed curves represent the mean number of coauthors over all papers; the black curves consider just those papers receiving more citations than the average for the field. Black curves are systematically above the dashed red ones, meaning that high-impact work is more likely to be produced by large teams than by small ones. Each panel corresponds to one of the three main disciplinary groups of papers indexed in the WoS: ( Nowadays, a team-authored paper in science and engineering is 6.3 times more likely to receive 1000 citations or more than a solo-authored paper, a difference that cannot be explained by self-citations ( ). One possible reason is a team's ability to come up with more novel combinations of ideas ( ) or to produce resources that are later used by others (e.g., genomics). Measurements show that teams are 38% more likely than solo authors to insert novel combinations into familiar knowledge domains, supporting the premise that teams can bring together different specialties, effectively combining knowledge to prompt scientific breakthroughs. Having more collaborations means greater visibility through a larger number of coauthors, who will likely introduce the work to their networks, an enhanced impact that may partially compensate for the fact that credit within a team must be shared with many colleagues ( Work from large teams garners, on average, more citations across a wide variety of domains. Research suggests that small teams tend to disrupt science and technology with new ideas and opportunities, whereas large teams develop existing ones ( ). Thus, it may be important to fund and foster teams of all sizes to temper the bureaucratization of science ( ), a trend underlying a fundamental change in team compositions. Scientific teams include both small, stable “core” teams and large, dynamically changing extended teams ( ). The increasing team size in most fields is driven by faster expansion of extended teams, which begin as small core teams but subsequently attract new members through a process of cumulative advantage anchored by productivity. Size is a crucial determinant of team survival strategies: Small teams survive longer if they maintain a stable core, but larger teams persist longer if they manifest a mechanism for membership turnover ( As science has accelerated and grown increasingly complex, the instruments required to expand the frontier of knowledge have increased in scale and precision. The tools of the trade become unaffordable to most individual investigators, but also to most institutions. Collaboration has been a critical solution, pooling resources to scientific advantage. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the world’s largest and most powerful particle collider, would have been unthinkable without collaboration, requiring more than 10,000 scientists and engineers from more than 100 countries. There is, however, a trade-off with increasing size that affects the value and risk associated with “big science” ( ). Although it may be possible to solve larger problems, the burden of reproducibility may require duplicating initial efforts, which may not be practically or economically feasible. Collaborators can have a large effect on scientific careers. According to recent studies ( ), scientists who lose their star collaborators experience a substantial drop in their productivity, especially if the lost collaborator was a regular coauthor. Publications involving extremely strong collaborators gain 17% more citations on average, pointing to the value of career partnership ( Given the increasing number of authors on the average research paper, who should and does gain the most credit? The canonical theory of credit (mis)allocation in science is the Matthew effect ( ), in which scientists of higher statuses involved in joint work receive outsized credit for their contributions. Properly allocating individual credit for a collaborative work is difficult because we cannot easily distinguish individual contributions ( ). It is possible, however, to inspect the cocitation patterns of the coauthors’ publications to determine the fraction of credit that the community assigns to each coauthor in a publication ( Scholarly citation remains the dominant measurable unit of credit in science. Given the reliance of most impact metrics on citations ( ), the dynamics of citation accumulation have been scrutinized by generations of scholars. From foundational work by Price ( ), we know that the distribution of citations for scientific papers is highly skewed: Many papers are never cited, but seminal papers can accumulate 10,000 or more citations. This uneven citation distribution is a robust, emergent property of the dynamics of science, and it holds when papers are grouped by institution ( ). If the number of citations of a paper is divided by the average number of citations collected by papers in the same discipline and year, the distribution of the resulting score is essentially indistinguishable for all disciplines ( ). This means that we can compare the impact of papers published in different disciplines by looking at their relative citation values. For example, a paper in mathematics collecting 100 citations represents a higher disciplinary impact than a paper in microbiology with 300 citations. ) The citation distributions of papers published in the same discipline and year lie on the same curve for most disciplines, if the raw number of citations   over all papers in that discipline and year. The dashed line is a lognormal fit. [Adapted from (  in 1964, selected for their distinct dynamics, displaying a “jump-decay” pattern (blue), experiencing a delayed peak (magenta), attracting a constant number of citations over time (green), or acquiring an increasing number of citations each year (red). ( . By rescaling the citation history of each paper in (B) by the appropriate (λ, μ, σ) parameters, the four papers collapse onto a single universal function, which is the same for all disciplines. [Adapted from ( The tail of the citation distribution, capturing the number of high-impact papers, sheds light on the mechanisms that drive the accumulation of citations. Recent analyses show that it follows a power law ( ), suggesting that the probability of citing a paper grows with the number of citations that it has already collected. Such a model can be augmented with other characteristic features of citation dynamics, such as the obsolescence of knowledge, decreasing the citation probability with the age of the paper ( ), and a fitness parameter, unique to each paper, capturing the appeal of the work to the scientific community ( ). Only a tiny fraction of papers deviate from the pattern described by such a model—some of which are called “sleeping beauties,” because they receive very little notice for decades after publication and then suddenly receive a burst of attention and citations ( The generative mechanisms described above can be used to predict the citation dynamics of individual papers. One predictive model ( ) assumes that the citation probability of a paper depends on the number of previous citations, an obsolescence factor, and a fitness parameter ( ). For a given paper, one can estimate the three model parameters by fitting the model to the initial portion of the citation history of the paper. The long-term impact of the work can be extrapolated ( ). Other studies have identified predictors of the citation impact of individual papers ( ), although the predictive power is reduced when accounting for the scientist’s career stage and the cumulative, nondecreasing nature of the  ). Eliminating inconsistencies in the use of quantitative evaluation metrics in science is crucial and highlights the importance of understanding the generating mechanisms behind commonly used statistics. Despite the discovery of universals across science, substantial disciplinary differences in culture, habits, and preferences make some cross-domain insights difficult to appreciate within particular fields and associated policies challenging to implement. The differences among the questions, data, and skills required by each discipline suggest that we may gain further insights from domain-specific SciSci studies that model and predict opportunities adapted to the needs of each field. For young scientists, the results of SciSci offer actionable insights about past patterns, helping guide future inquiry within their disciplines (  Left bare, truly innovative and highly interdisciplinary ideas may not reach maximum scientific impact. To enhance their impact, novel ideas should be placed in the context of established knowledge (  A scientist is never too old to make a major discovery, as long as he or she stays productive (  Research is shifting to teams, so engaging in collaboration is beneficial. Works by small teams tend to be more disruptive, whereas those by big teams tend to have more impact (  Most credit will go to the coauthors with the most consistent track record in the domain of the publication (  Although review panels acknowledge innovation, they ultimately tend to discount it. Funding agencies should ask reviewers to assess innovation, not only expected success ( The contribution of SciSci is a detailed understanding of the relational structure between scientists, institutions, and ideas, a crucial starting point that facilitates the identification of fundamental generating processes. Together, these data-driven efforts complement contributions from related research domains such as the economics ( ). Causal estimation is a prime example, in which econometric matching techniques demand and leverage comprehensive data sources in the effort to simulate counterfactual scenarios ( ). Assessing causality is one of the most needed future developments in SciSci: Many descriptive studies reveal strong associations between structure and outcomes, but the extent to which a specific structure “causes” an outcome remains unexplored. Engaging in tighter partnerships with experimentalists, SciSci will be able to better identify associations discovered from models and large-scale data that have causal force to enrich their policy relevance. But experimenting on science may be the biggest challenge SciSci has yet to face. Running randomized, controlled trials that can alter outcomes for individuals or institutions of science, which are mostly supported by tax dollars, is bound to elicit criticisms and pushback ( ). Hence, we expect quasi-experimental approaches to prevail in SciSci investigations in the near future. Most SciSci research focuses on publications as primary data sources, implying that insights and findings are limited to ideas successful enough to merit publication in the first place. Yet most scientific attempts fail, sometimes spectacularly. Given that scientists fail more often than they succeed, knowing when, why, and how an idea fails is essential in our attempts to understand and improve science. Such studies could provide meaningful guidance regarding the reproducibility crisis and help us account for the file drawer problem. They could also substantially further our understanding of human imagination by revealing the total pipeline of creative activity. Science often behaves like an economic system with a one-dimensional “currency” of citation counts. This creates a hierarchical system, in which the “rich-get-richer” dynamics suppress the spread of new ideas, particularly those from junior scientists and those who do not fit within the paradigms supported by specific fields. Science can be improved by broadening the number and range of performance indicators. The development of alternative metrics covering web ( ) is critical in this regard. Other measurable dimensions include the information (e.g., data) that scientists share with competitors ( ). But with a profusion of metrics, more work is needed to understand what each of them does and does not capture to ensure meaningful interpretation and avoid misuse. SciSci can make an essential contribution by providing models that offer a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that govern performance indicators in science. For instance, models of the empirical patterns observed when alternative indicators (e.g., distributions of paper downloads) are used will enable us to explore their relationship with citation-based metrics ( The integration of citation-based metrics with alternative indicators will promote pluralism and enable new dimensions of productive specialization, in which scientists can be successful in different ways. Science is an ecosystem that requires not only publications, but also communicators, teachers, and detail-oriented experts. We need individuals who can ask novel, field-altering questions, as well as those who can answer them. It would benefit science if curiosity, creativity, and intellectual exchange—particularly regarding the societal implications and applications of science and technology—are better appreciated and incentivized in the future. A more pluralistic approach could reduce duplication and make science flourish for society ( An issue that SciSci seeks to address is the allocation of science funding. The current peer review system is subject to biases and inconsistencies ( ). Several alternatives have been proposed, such as the random distribution of funding ( ), person-directed funding that does not involve proposal preparation and review ( ), removing human reviewers altogether by allocating funds through a performance measure ( A critical area of future research for SciSci concerns the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in a way that involves machines and minds working together. These new tools portend far-reaching implications for science because machines might broaden a scientist’s perspective more than human collaborators. For instance, the self-driving vehicle is the result of a successful combination of known driving habits and information that was outside of human awareness, provided by sophisticated machine-learning techniques. Mind-machine partnerships have improved evidence-based decision-making in a wide range of health, economic, social, legal, and business problems ( ). How can science be improved with mind-machine partnerships, and what arrangements are most productive? These questions promise to help us understand the science of the future. J. Wang, R.

Originally written by Lisa Wald (U.S. Geological Survey) for “The Green Frog News” A normal (dip-slip) fault is an inclined fracture where the rock mass above an inclined fault moves down (Public domain.)  is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the  . The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the  . These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can’t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the   that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock!  scald=78638:float_right {"link":"%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2Fcrust-mantle-and-core-earth"}  A simplified cartoon of the crust (brown), mantle (orange), and core (liquid in light gray, solid in dark gray) of the earth. (Public domain.) . The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece – it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of the earth. Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. We call these puzzle pieces  . The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake. The tectonic plates divide the Earth's crust into distinct "plates" that are always slowly moving. Earthquakes are concentrated along these plate boundaries. (Public domain.) While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the   of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of   like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth’s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us!  scald=78580:float_right {"link":"%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2Fcartoon-sketch-seismograph"}  The cartoon sketch of the seismograph shows how the insrument shakes with the earth below it, but the recording device remains stationary (instead of the other way around). (Public domain.) . The seismograph has a base that sets firmly in the ground, and a heavy weight that hangs free. When an earthquake causes the ground to shake, the base of the seismograph shakes too, but the hanging weight does not. Instead the spring or string that it is hanging from absorbs all the movement. The difference in position between the shaking part of the seismograph and the motionless part is what is recorded. The size of an earthquake depends on the size of the fault and the amount of slip on the fault, but that’s not something scientists can simply measure with a measuring tape since faults are many kilometers deep beneath the earth’s surface. So how do they measure an earthquake? They use the   at the surface of the earth to determine how large the earthquake was (figure 5). A short wiggly line that doesn’t wiggle very much means a small earthquake, and a long wiggly line that wiggles a lot means a large earthquake. The length of the wiggle depends on the size of the fault, and the size of the wiggle depends on the amount of slip.  of shaking from an earthquake, and this varies depending on where you are during the earthquake. An example of a seismic wave with the P wave and S wave labeled. (Public domain.) Seismograms come in handy for locating earthquakes too, and being able to see the   is important. You learned how P & S waves each shake the ground in different ways as they travel through it. P waves are also faster than S waves, and this fact is what allows us to tell where an earthquake was. To understand how this works, let’s compare P and S waves to lightning and thunder. Light travels faster than sound, so during a thunderstorm you will first see the lightning and then you will hear the thunder. If you are close to the lightning, the thunder will boom right after the lightning, but if you are far away from the lightning, you can count several seconds before you hear the thunder. The further you are from the storm, the longer it will take between the lightning and the thunder. P waves are like the lightning, and S waves are like the thunder. The P waves travel faster and shake the ground where you are first. Then the S waves follow and shake the ground also. If you are close to the earthquake, the P and S wave will come one right after the other, but if you are far away, there will be more time between the two.  scald=78645:float_right {"link":"%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2Fp-waves-and-s-waves-crust"}  P Waves alternately compress and stretch the crustal material parallel to the direction they are propagating. S Waves cause the crustal material to move back and forth perpendicular to the direction they are travelling. (Public domain.) By looking at the amount of time between the P and S wave on a seismogram recorded on a seismograph, scientists can tell how far away the earthquake was from that location. However, they can’t tell in what direction from the seismograph the earthquake was, only how far away it was. If they draw a circle on a map around the station where the   of the circle is the determined distance to the earthquake, they know the earthquake lies somewhere on the circle. But where?  to determine exactly where the earthquake was (see image below). It is called triangulation because a triangle has three sides, and it takes three seismographs to locate an earthquake. If you draw a circle on a map around three different seismographs where the   of each is the distance from that station to the earthquake, the intersection of those three circles is the  No, and it is unlikely they will ever be able to predict them. Scientists have tried many different ways of predicting earthquakes, but none have been successful. On any particular fault, scientists know there will be another earthquake sometime in the future, but they have no way of telling when it will happen. Is there such a thing as earthquake weather? Can some animals or people tell when an earthquake is about to hit? These are two questions that do not yet have definite answers. If weather does affect earthquake occurrence, or if some animals or people can tell when an earthquake is coming, we do not yet understand how it works.  scald=78647:full_width {"link":"\/media\/images\/triangulation-locate-earthquake"}  Triangulation can be used to locate an earthquake. The seismometers are shown as green dots. The calculated distance from each seismometer to the earthquake is shown as a circle. The location where all the circles intersect is the location of the earthquake epicenter. (Public domain.)

         funding opportunity. The Science of Science: Discovery, Communication, and Impact (SoS:DCI) program is designed to increase the public value of scientific activity. The program pursues this goal by supporting basic research in three fundamental areas:   The SoS:DCI program, which builds upon the former Science of Science & Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program, funds research that builds theoretical and empirical understandings of these three areas. With this goal in mind, proposals should:  Provide credible metrics and rigorous assessments of their proposed project’s impact. Include robust data management plans with the goal to increase the usability, validity, and reliability of scientific materials. See  The SoS:DCI program places a high priority on broadening participation. It encourages leadership from junior faculty, women, members of historically underrepresented groups, and proposals from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), Research Undergraduate Institutions (RUIs), and EPSCoR states. Of particular interest are proposals that have the highest potential to strengthen America’s global leadership in science and increase national competitiveness across a broad range of domains. These include proposals that analyze strategies for strengthening and diversifying the scientific workforce, as well as ways to more effectively cultivate high-impact discovery across sectors. The program strongly encourages convergent research and collaboration. SoS:DCI supports small grants that are time-critical and small grants that are high-risk and of a potentially transformative nature. See Chapter II.E.1 and Chapter II.E.2 of the NSF Proposal and Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) (NSF 19-1) ( ) for guidance on submitting Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) and EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) proposals.  SoS:DCI supports interdisciplinary projects whose scientific advances lie in great part outside the scope of a single program or discipline, such that substantial funding support from more than one program or discipline is necessary. See Chapter II.E.3 of the NSF Proposal and Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) (NSF 19-1) ( SoS:DCI supports collaboration between academic research institutions and industry. See Chapter II.E.4 of the NSF Proposal and Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) (NSF 19-1) ( SoS:DCI supports CAREER awards. The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a foundation-wide activity that offers the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. Activities pursued by early-career faculty should build a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research. NSF encourages submission of CAREER proposals from early-career faculty at all CAREER-eligible organizations and especially encourages women, members of underrepresented minority groups and persons with disabilities to apply. Interested researchers can find additional information on the  SoS:DCI funds conferences and interdisciplinary research activities that strengthen understanding and dissemination of the research topic among the social and behavioral sciences, policy community and the larger scientific community.

  The omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid attenuates organic dust-induced airway inflammation


    
  
 
      
      Workers exposed to organic dusts from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are at risk for developing airway inflammatory diseases. Available preventative and therapeutic measures for alleviating dust-induced lung disease are inadequate. Because omega-3 fatty acids can mitigate inflammatory processes, we aimed to determine whether nutritional supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could reduce the airway inflammatory consequences of exposures to organic dust. Aqueous extracts of organic dusts from swine CAFOs (ODE) were utilized. In DHA-pretreated human bronchial epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts, monocyte cell cultures, and precision-cut murine lung slices, we found that DHA pretreatment dose-dependently decreased ODE-induced inflammatory cytokine production. To determine the in vivo significance of DHA, C57BL/6 mice were orally administered DHA for seven days prior to treatment with intranasal ODE or saline inhalations. Animals treated with 2 mg DHA demonstrated significant reductions in ODE-induced bronchial alveolar lavage neutrophil influx and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production compared to mice exposed to ODE alone. Collectively, these data demonstrate that DHA affects several lung cells to reduce the airway inflammatory response to organic dust exposures. Dietary supplementation with DHA may be an effective therapeutic strategy to reduce the airway inflammatory consequences in individuals exposed to agriculture dust environments.

  Personal exposure of dairy workers to dust, endotoxin, muramic acid, ergosterol, and ammonia on large-scale dairies in the high plains Western United States


    
  
 
      
      Dairy workers experience a high degree of bioaerosol exposure, composed of an array of biological and chemical constituents, which have been tied to adverse health effects. A better understanding of the variation in the magnitude and composition of exposures by task is needed to inform worker protection strategies. To characterize the levels and types of exposures, 115 dairy workers grouped into three task categories on nine farms in the high plains Western United States underwent personal monitoring for inhalable dust, endotoxin, 3-hydroxy fatty acids (3-OHFA), muramic acid, ergosterol, and ammonia through one work shift. Eighty-nine percent of dairy workers were exposed to endotoxin at concentrations exceeding the recommended exposure guidelines (adjusted for a long work shift). The proportion of workers with exposures exceeding recommended guidelines was lower for inhalable dust (12%), and ammonia (1%). Ergosterol exposures were only measurable on 28% of samples, primarily among medical workers and feed handlers. Milking parlor workers were exposed to significantly higher inhalable dust, endotoxin, 3-OHFA, ammonia, and muramic acid concentrations compared to workers performing other tasks. Development of large modern dairies has successfully made progress in reducing worker exposures and lung disease prevalence. However, exposure to endotoxin, dust, and ammonia continues to present a significant risk to worker health on North American dairies, especially for workers in milking parlors. This study was among the first to concurrently evaluate occupational exposure to assayable endotoxin (lipid A), 3-hydroxy fatty acids or 3-OHFA (a chemical measure of cell bound and noncell-bound endotoxins), muramic acid, ergosterol, and ammonia among workers on Western U.S. dairies. There remains a need for cost-effective, culturally acceptable intervention strategies integrated in OHS Risk Management and production systems to further optimize worker health and farm productivity.

  journal      = {Scientific American}, Calcium and other base cation levels in air and precipitation from the 1950`s to the 1990`s can be as important as sulfate and other acidic species in understanding acid rain trends (or basic rain trends). Precipitation quality data, air quality data, and estimates of sources of dust emissions are used to address the issue of calcium trends in the atmosphere. The apparent downward trend for calcium in precipitation from the 1950`s to the 1970`s is suggested to be due mainly to a change in sample collection methods while the decrease since the mid-1970`s is due to a real decrease in Spatial characterization of acid rain stress in Canadian Shield Lakes. Progress report, 1 August 1986-1 February 1987 The acidification of lake waters from airborne pollution is of continental proportions both in North America and Europe. A major concern of the acid rain problem is the cumulative ecosystem damage to lakes and forest. The number of lakes affected in northeastern U.S. and on the Canadian Shield is though to be enormous. How seasonal changes in lake transparency are related to annual acidic load was examined. The relationship between variations in lake acidification and ecophysical units was also examined. The utility of Thematic Mapper based observations to measure seasonal changes in the optical transparency in acid lakes was investigated. Various seemingly paradoxical scientific questions are posed which relate to the problem of acid rain and its effect on the environment and environmental policy. The first paradox discussed concerns the supposed increase in fossil fuel usage over the last several decades, with the resultant increases in emissions of pollutants from the combustion of fuels which cause acid rain. Despite these increases, experts do not agree on whether acidity of rain has increased in eastern North America. The second paradox concerns the effect of acid rain on vegetation. If the rain is supposedly harmful, why have some reports shown increases and Long-term daily precipitation data from NCDC are used to investigate the changes of light rain events from 1973-2009 over North America, Europe and Asia. Results reveal that the trend of light rain events presents a remarkably diverse feature in different regions, while an overall decrease trend can be found over the continents in northern hemisphere. In North America, most of stations show a decrease trend for light rain on the annual basis but a decrease trend can also be found for moderate and heavy rain. The opposite trends are observed over the stations in Europe and the trend of light Acid rain, says Boyle is a chemical leprosy eating into the face of North America and Europe, perhaps the major ecological problem of our time. Boyle describes the causes and scope of the phenomenon; the effects on man, wildlife, water, and our cultural heritage. He probes the delays of politicians and the frequent self-serving arguments advanced by industry in the face of what scientists have proved. The solutions he offers are to strengthen the Clean Air Act and require emission reductions that can be accomplished by establishing emission standards on a regional or bubble basis, burn low-sulfur coal, install scrubbers

Google has not performed a legal analysis and makes no representation as to the accuracy of the date listed.) The present invention relates to acid-soluble cement compositions that comprise cement kiln dust ("CKD") and associated methods of use. An embodiment provides a method of cementing comprising: providing an acid-soluble cement composition comprising a kiln dust and water; allowing the acid-soluble cement composition to set to form an acid-soluble hardened mass; and contacting the acid-soluble hardened mass with an acid.  [0001] The preseni invention relates to cementing operations and, more particularly, in certain embodiments, to acid-soluble cement compositions that comprise cement kiln dust (  [0002] Cement compositions may be used in a variety of subterranean applications. For example, in subterranean well construction, a pipe string (e.g., easing, liners, expandable tubuiars, etc.) may be run into a well bore and cemented in place. The process of cementing the pipe string in place is commonly referred to as "primary cementing/' In a typical primary cementing method, a cement composition may be pumped into an annuius between the walls of the well bore and the exterio surface of the pipe string disposed therein. The cement composition may set in the annular space, thereby forming an annular sheath of hardened, substantially impermeable cement (i, ,, a cement sheath) that may support and position the pipe string in the well bore and may bond the exterior surface of the pipe string to the subterranean formation, Among other things, the cement sheath surrounding the pipe string functions to prevent the migration of fluids in the annuius, as well as protecting the pipe string from corrosion. Cement compositions also may be used in remedial cementing methods, for example, to sea! cracks o holes in pipe strings or cement sheaths, to seal highly permeable formation zones or fractures, to place a cement plug, and th like. Cement compositions also may be used in surface applications, for example, construction cementing,   [0003] In some applications, it may be desirable for the cement composition to be acid soluble. For instance, an acid-soluble cement composition may be desirable in applications where it is anticipated that the hardened cement will be removed in subsequent well bore operations. One particular application includes use of an acid-soluble cement composition to plug permeable zones in a formation that may allow the undesired flow of  fluid into, or from, the well bore. For example, the permeable atones may result in the loss of circulation of fluids, such as a drilling fluid or a cement composition, in the well bore or an undesired influx of gas or water into the well bore. The permeable zones include, for example, vugs, voids, fractures (natural, or otherwise produced) and the like. Other applications for acid-soiuble cement compositions include, for example, the formation of annular plugs and isolation of gravel-packed well bore intervals. Examples of acid-soluble cement compositions include those comprising Sorei cements and Portland cements.

[0008] The features and advantages, of the present: in vention wil l be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. While numerous changes may be made by those skilled in the art, such changes are within the spirit of the invention. 

  [0009] The present invention relates to cementing operations and, more particularly, in certain embodiments, to acid-soluble cement compositions that comprise C D and associated methods of use. There may be several potential advantages to the methods and compositions of the present invention, only some of which may be alluded to herein. One of the many potential advantages of embodiments of the present invention is that the inclusion of the CKD in the acid-soluble cement compositions should reduce the amount of, or potentially eliminate, a higher cost additive, such as Portland or Sorel cement, resulting in a more economical ceme.nl composition. Another potential advantage of embodiments of the present invention is that reduction of the amount of Portland cement should reduce the carbon footprint of the acid-soluble cement compositions.   [0010] Embodiments of the aeicl-sokibie cement compositions of the present invention may comprise CKD. Additional embodiments of the acid-soluble cement compositions may comprise a hydraulic cement; a component selected from the group consisting of CKD, a. natural pozzolan, and a combination thereof and water. In an embodiment, the hydraulic cement ma comprise Sorel cement. In another embodiment, the cement compositions may further comprise an acid-soluble filler. in additional, embodiments, the cement compositions may comprise CKD and be tree of any acid-soluble fillers. In yet another embodiment, the cement compositions may further comprise a source of calcium ions (e.g., hydraied lime).. Other optional additives may also be included in embodiments of the cement compositions of the present invention as desired, including, but not limited to. .fly ash, slag cement, metakaolin, shale, zeolite, combinations thereof, and the like, Additionally, embodiments of the cement compositions of the present invention may be foamed and/or extended as desired by those of ordinary skill in the art.   [00 i 1] The acid-soluble cement compositions of the present invention should have a density suitable .for a particular application as desired by those of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, in some embodiments, the cement compositions of the present invention may have a density in the range of from about 8 pounds per gallon ("ppg") to about 16 ppg. In other embodiments, the cement compositions ma be foamed to a density in the range of from about 8 ppg to about 1.3 ppg.   [0012] Embodiments of the acid-soluble cement compositions of the present invention ma comprise a hydraulic cement, A variety of hydraulic cements may be utilized in accordance with the present invention, including, but not limited to, those comprising calcium, aluminum, silicon, oxygen, iron, and/o sulfur, which set and harden by reaction with water. Suitable hydraulic cements include, but are not limited to, Sore! cements. 

 Portland cements, pozzolana cements, gypsum cements, high alumina content cements, slag cements, silica cements, and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the hydraulic cement may comprise a Portland cement. In some embodiments, the Portland cements that are suited for use in the present invention are classified as Classes A, C, G, and H cements according to American Petroleum institute, API Specification for Materials and Testing for Well Cements, API Specification 10, Fifth Ed, July 1 , 1990. in addition, in some embodiments, cements suitable for use in the present invention may be classified as AST Type I, 11, or  111. As will be discussed in more detail below, acid-soluble fillers can be used with hydraulic cements {such as Portland cement) thai do harden into an acid-soluble mass.   [0013] Where present, the hydraulic cement generally may be included in the acid- soluble cement compositions in an amount sufficient to provide the desired compressive strength, density, and/or cost, lit accordance with embodiments, at least a portion of the hydraulic cement and potentially eve all of the hydraulic cement, may be replaced with Cf D and/or a natural pozzofan. In an embodiment, at a least a portion of the hydraulic cement i replaced with C D and/or a natural pozzolan. in some embodiments, the hydraulic cement may be present in the cement compositions of the present inventio in an amount in the range of 0% to about 99% b weight of cementitious components. As used herein, the term "by weight of cementitious components" refers to the concentration of the particular component by weight of total amount of cementitious components included in the cement composition, Cementitious components include those components or combinations of components of the cement compositions that hydraulic-ally set, or otherwise harden, to develop compressive strength, including, for example. Sore! cement, Portland cement, CKD, fly ash, pumice, slag, lime, shale, and the like. For example, the cementitious components may comprise the hydraulic cement and any additional cementitious components that may be present in the acid-soluble cement composition. The hydraulic cement may be present, in certain embodiments, in an. amount of about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 90%, or about 95%, in an embodiment, the hydraulic cement may be present in an amount in the range of 0% to about 95% by weight of cementitious components, in another embodiment, the hydraulic cement may be present in an amount in the range of about 20% to about 95% by weight of cementitious components. In yet another embodiment, the hydraulic cement may be present in an amount in the range of about 50% to about 90% by weight of cementitious components. One of ordinary skill in the an, with the benefit of this disclosure, 

 will recognize the appropriate amount of the hydraulic cement to include for a chosen application,   [0014] An example of a suitable hydraulic cement comprises a Sorel cement Sorel cements typically include magnesia-based cement systems formed from a mixture of magnesium oxide and magnesium chloride. However, as used herein, the term "Sorel cement" is intended to encompass any of a variety of metal oxides and soluble salts which together form a hydraulic cement, in the presence of water, the metal oxide and the soluble salt forming the Sorel cement should solidify into an acid-soluble mass. Embodiments of the Sorel cements should rapidly develop a desirable compressive strength, in accordance with embodiments, at least a portion of the Sorel cement may be replaced with C D and/or a natural poacsolan. In an embodiment, at a least a portion of the soluble salt is replaced with CKD and/or a natural poxzolan.  In one particular embodiment, the Sorel cement comprises an alkaline earth metal oxide, such as magnesium, oxide. A suitable metal oxide is THERMATEI LT additive, available from Halliburton Energy Services, inc. The metal oxide present in the Sorel cement should have an activity level sufficient to provide the desired reactivity. For example, the higher the activity level of the metal oxide, the fester the reaction of the metal oxide with the other components of the Sorel cement to -form the hardened mass. The activity level of the metal oxide may vary based on a number of factors. For example, the particle size differential of the metal oxide particles may affect the activity level. A smaller particle size differential may result in a higher activity level due, inter alia, to a greater surface area. Another factor that may affect the activity level of the metal oxide is a sintering process. By varying the heat applied during, and time of. the sintering process, metal oxide with varying activity levels may be provided. Metal oxide that has not been treated by a sintering process may have a very high activity level, and thus it may be highly reactive in the Sorel cements. In an embodiment, a relatively more reactive metal oxide may be desired, such as where it may be desired to have a cement composition with a relatively short set time, for example, whet) desired to rapidly sea! off a permeable zone. In an alternative embodiment, a relatively less reactive metal oxide may be desired, for example, where a delay may be desired between mixing the cement composition and the formation of a hardened mass.   [0016] A wide variety of soluble salts are suitable for use in the Sorel cement, including metal chlorides. .In one embodiment, the Sorel cement comprises an alkaline earth metal chloride, such as magnesium chloride. An example of a suitable magnesium chloride is C-TEK additive, available .from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. I an alternative 

 embodiment, the Sore! cement comprises magnesium sulfate or ammonium mono or dibasic phosphate.   [0017] In an embodiment, the Sore! cement may comprise the metal oxide and the soluble salt in a metal-oxide-to-soluble-salt ratio of about. 3: 1 to about 1 :3. in another embodiment, the metai-oxide-to-aoiuble-sait ratio may range from about 2:1 to about \ :2. In yet another embodiment, the meial~oxide~io~soluble~saIt ratio may range from about 1.5:1 to about 1 : 1.5, One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the appropriate ratio of the metal oxide and soluble salt to include for a. particular application.   [001.8] Embodiments of the acid-soluble cement compositions generally may comprise CKD, which is a material generated in the manufacture of cement CKD, as that term is used herein, refers to a partially calcined kiln feed which is removed from the gas stream and collected, for example, in. a dust collector during the manufacture of cement. Usually, large quantities of CKD are collected in the production of cement that are commonly disposed of as waste. Disposal of the CKD as waste can add undesirable costs to the manufacture of the cement, as well as the environmental concerns associated with, its disposal. The chemical analysis of CKD from various cement manufactures varies depending on a number of factors, including the particular kiln feed, the efficiencies of the cement production, operation, and the associated dust collection, systems. CKD generally may comprise a variety of oxides, such as SiOa, AI 2O3, FejOj, Ca.0, gO, SO3, a^O. and K?0. The term "CKD" Is used herein to mean cement kiln dust made as described above and equivalent forms of cement kiln, dust made in other ways,   f00l9| The CKD generally may exhibit cementitious properties, in that it may set and harden in. the presence of water. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the CKD may be used, among other things, to replace higher cost cementitious components,, such as Portland cement and/or Sore! cement, resulting in more economical cement compositions, in addition, substitution of the CKD for the Portland and/or Sorel. cement should result in a cement composition with a reduced carbon footprint.   [0020] The CKD may be included in the acid-soluble cement compositions in an amount sufficient to provide the desired compressive strength, density, cost reduction, and/or reduced carbon footprint. In some embodiments, the CK D may be present in the cement compositions of the present invention in an amount in the range of from about 1% to 100% by weight of cementitious components. For example, the CKD may be present in an amount of about 5%, about 10%, about .15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 05%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 90%, or about 95%. hi one embodiment;, the CKD may be present in an 

 amount in the range of from about 5% to about 99% by weight of eementitious components.

Find more information on The heterogeneous uptake of formic acid and acetic acid on mineral dust and coal fly ash was investigated using Knudsen cell reactor over the temperature range from 263 to 298 K. The uptake of formic acid and acetic acid on Inner Mongolia desert, Arizona test dust, and coal fly ash was mainly physical adsorption, while the uptake process on Xinjiang sierozem was the combination of physical adsorption and chemical adsorption as it contained a considerable amount of calcite. Uptake coefficients of formic acid and acetic acid on mineral dust increased with the content of element Si, aluminosilicate, and/or quartz in mineralogy, but the uptake coefficients on coal fly ash were smaller than that on mineral dust, which was controlled by the chemical components and microstructure. Compared with formic acid, uptake coefficients of acetic acid were higher on mineral dust and coal fly ash, especially in the low temperature regions. The atmospheric implications of formic acid and acetic acid on mineral dust aerosols are also discussed. Correlation coefficient between the uptake coefficient and Na mass fraction (Table S5); SEM image of Xinjiang sierozem mineral dust at 5 μm level (Figure S1); XRD spectrum of inner Mongolia desertification (Figure S2); element mass percentage of Inner Mongolia desertification, Xinjiang sierozem, Arizona test dust and coal fly ash using XRF (XL 3t980) (Table S1); physical properties of formic acid and acetic acid (Table S2) ( Electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.
