Who is Mycroft?
AI FOR EVERYONE
Mycroft is the world’s first open source voice assistant. It can run anywhere – on a desktop computer, inside an automobile, it even runs on a Raspberry Pi. It is open so it can be remixed, extended, improved. It can be used in anything from a science project to an enterprise software application.
What Can Mycroft do?
I can help you get stuff done, seamlessly, without looking for the right button to push. Just use your voice to tell me how I can assist you.

Mycroft is primarily software. What you see in the video is our reference device Mark 1.

Why open source?
We believe the future of AI should be open, not a cryptic black box only few understand and have control over.
Building this new technology together, collaborating, sharing ideas and building on top of each other – that’s how we see it.


Mycroft is the name of a suite of software and hardware tools that use natural language processing and machine learning to provide an open source voice assistant.
Mycroft components

Mycroft is modular. Some components can be easily 'swapped out' for others:
Wake Word detection Speech to Text (STT) Intent parser 
Mycroft Skills
Mycroft Skills are like 'add-ons' or 'plugins' that provide additional functionality. Skills can be developed by Mycroft developers, or by Community developers, and vary in their functionality and maturity.
Mycroft Skills Management (msm) is a set of helper scripts that assist in the installation and management of Skills.
